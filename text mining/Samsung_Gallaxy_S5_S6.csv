I did not think it was possible for a phone, as new and advanced as the S5, to NOT have 4G capability. The first month I owned the phone, I thought I wasn't getting 4G due to poor network connections. Then I finally looked at my friend's phone, an older Samsung Note 3, and saw he had 4G. We both have the same network. Then I reread the specifications. Now I realized, why they included so much nonsense specifications such as: ""B10 (E-GSM 900MHz), B13 (DCS 1,800MHz), B14 (PCS 1,900MHz) 3G UMTS B1 (IMT 2,100MHz), B2 (PCS 1,900MHz), B5 (US 850MHz Cellular), B8 (GSM 900MHz)"" Have you ever read one cell phone review, mentioning any of the above specifications? No. All they are trying to do is HIDE the fact that it DOES NOT contain 4G. Thankfully, I called Amazon, complained, and as Amazon always seems to do, they saved the day by accepting a return with FULL refund =). Just FYI,Samsung S5 SM-G900H translates into NO 4G. You have to purchase the S5 SM-G900F in order to get 4G. Same price, too. I have no clue why they are selling a phone as advanced as the S5, WITHOUT 4G, and at the SAME PRICE, no less. Completely mind-boggling. If you HATE 4G, then this phone is for you. ;)",bjorn hansen,Samsung_S5,1

There are plenty of new features and advances with the S5 but those who already own a S4 likely will not be rushing to get the S5. I'm coming from an iPhone 4S so the S5 offers a lot of new features for me and provides plenty to love. FEATURES & UPGRADES FROM S4: 1. SIZE: The S5 is slightly larger at 5.59"" x 2.85"" x 0.32"" and weighing in at 5.11 oz compared to the S4 at 5.38"" x 2.75"" x 0.31"" and weighing at 4.59 oz. The S5 is lightweight and feels good in my hand. 2. DURABILITY: If there is one new feature on the S5 that is a game changer it's got to be the IP67 certification. IP67 certified means the S5 has total protection against dust and can survive being underwater for up to 30 minutes at a depth of 1m or less. In order to be protected against water the S5 has a little plastic plug to cover the charging jack on the bottom of the phone. This needs to be in place and the back must be properly snapped into place to prevent water damage. I'm not about to test the IP67 certification however the guys at TechSmartt performed 2 water tests on the S5 that can be viewed on YouTube. First they let the S5 sit in pool at a depth of 1m for 1 hour, not 30 minutes. Second they sent the S5 through a normal wash cycle in a washing machine while in the pocket of a pair of jeans. In both tests, the S5 survived and functioned perfectly afterward. The durability of the S4 came under fire after many people reported cracked screens after minor drops. Samsung stuck with a plastic back for the S5 but did improve upon the durability of the smartphone. In separate drop tests again conducted by TechSmartt, the S5 faired better than the S4 and better than the iPhone 5s. However the S5 didn't fair as well as the durably built HTC One M8. The tests are a decent indication but should also be taken at face value since there is no way to ensure each phone fell the same way. 3. SCREEN: The S5's new screen is nothing short of stunning. The S5 screen is 5.1"" which is slightly larger than the 5.0"" screen on the S4. The resolution remains 1080 x 1920 pixels so the pixel density is slightly less at 432 ppi. The screen does look noticeably better than the S4's screen and has richer colors, better contrast, whiter whites, and blacker blacks than my iPad 3 when viewing identical images. Displaymate who extensively tests smartphone screens said the S5's screen is ""the best performing smartphone display that we have ever tested."" Displaymate's tests indicted the S5 screen is 22% brighter than the S4 and 13% brighter than the Note 3. The S5 also has outstanding color accuracy. In addition it features a Professional Photo Mode that provides an accurate calibration to the Adobe RGB standard, this is a rare feature in consumer displays. 4. CAMERA: The S5 sports a 16MP camera rear camera up from 13MP in the S4. The front facing camera remains pretty much the same at 2.1MP. The S5's 1/2.6"" sensor is larger being closer in size to sensors from P&S cameras than smartphones. The AF is also speedier with the S5 due to its hybrid use of phase detection and contrast detection AF. The S5 is the first camera on a smartphone to use phase detection AF, which is commonly found in DSLR cameras. Other smartphones only use contrast detection AF that simply focuses by measuring the contrast between nearby pixels. This type of AF tends to be slower and not work well if shooting in situations where there isn't much contrast. Phase detection AF however focuses by comparing the actual light received by sensors. COMPARING S5 & 5s IMAGES: Comparing daytime images shot with the S5 against images of the same subject shot with the iPhone 5s, the Samsung's images disappoint in spite of being 16MP vs 8MP with the 5s. At 16MP the S5's resolution is 2988x5312. The images are therefore at a 16:9 ratio. The iPhone 5s's resolution is 2448x3264. The images are therefore at a",JJG,Samsung_S5,2

The only flaw is that the S5 cable will not charge S4 and vice versa ! What is wrong with you techo guys at Samsung.

I am an app developer and I use/own many Android and iOS devices and this one has disappointed me the most. First, this unlocked version of mine came with a USB 2.0 cable for some reason whereas the phone actually has a 3.0 port, even though the box was sealed and didn't looked like it was opened to switch the cables. I realized that I should have received a USB 3.0 cable after my return period expired so I had to purchase the 3.0 cable separately. But that's not the reason for my plight. The phone would take an unusually long (6-8 hrs) time to charge upto a 100%. At first I thought it was the USB 2.0 cable which caused such a delay in charging it's ginormous battery, but even with a USB 3.0 cable, things aren't any better. I thought it might be the USB debugging setting that was messing with the cables charging properties, but after looking at it everything seemed normal, but the phone would still take a long long time to charge. Next, I use a 32 GB UHS SD Card with my S4 which I transferred into this phone and the phone is super slow in reading and writing into the SD card. As soon as I pop it back into the S4 it just works fine, the SD card also worked fine on my other devices and my computer as well, so I saved the data and formatted the SD card and then tried to use it in this S5, but same story, it's too damn slow in reading and writing to the SD card. Not to mention other knick-knacks, like the fingerprint scanner. It's just a failed implementation in this device and has terrible use cases. So just like everyone else I disabled that as well. What's the point of a feature if you cannot use it without sacrificing convenience? Also, camera modes doesn't work when camera is launched from lock screen with a pin/password, but this one can be fixed with a software update. The heart rate monitor gives bogus numbers more than 90% of the time and I am a healthy person and I own a separate heart rate and blood pressure monitor. Last but not the least, no LTE is really a bummer. The biggest caveat is : This phone must be used to make a cumulative of 5 mins call from a SIM belonging to the Americas in order for it to be usable in other regions or countries. If the phone is activated using a Non-American SIM, it will cause permanent unwanted changes (unclear as to what change) to the phone at which point it will need to be serviced by Samsung Service center. So if you buy this, use it first with a SIM card that belongs to American carrier (The North, South, Central or Caribbean) in at least a call over 5 minutes or multiple cumulative calls that adds up to more than or equal to 5 minutes. I have bought unlocked phones before, and this is one of the oddest of requirements I have ever seen, plus there is no where that this is mentioned in Black and White until you buy this phone and realize this warning written on a sticker on the box with tiniest fonts available. Overall build quality is good, display is not much better than S4 other than the size. Bottom line is, I have put it up for sale in craigslist already and I would stick with S4 and Note 3 for now. Could be a good buy for first time Samsung users.",Anjan,Samsung_S5,4

Really realized there was a problem when I tried to mute a call yesterday and couldn't. I called Samsung to see what can be done and they said I would have to go through the seller because they won't honor warranties on international products. Luckily, I am still within 30 days so I am returning the phone via the Amazon A-Z return policy. I have listed some of the issues I have observed below and have left my original review below that. The warranty on this phone has to go through to country of origin, which Samsung claims in Levant. I didn't even try it. While in call, the phone was missing the mute, call waiting, 3 way call functions (they appear after factory reset, but I haven't been able to verify that they work. It keeps saying to make sure the back is firmly sealed, even though it is. The gestures do not work most of the time (Pausing/muting music and calls, taking pictures) The pulse reader often won't read The fingerprint reader doesn't want to read Too many issues from the start, especially with no warranty. I assume it would be an amazing phone if all the features worked properly. Great phone. This international unlocked version comes with an international charger which I cannot use in the US, but other than that all my expectations where met. The phone was in a sealed package. It came in perfect condition and all expected accessories were included. I have Straight Talk, so all I had to do was purchase a $6.99 ATT SIM card conversion from Straight Talk and call their customer service to get the APN settings correct and I was good to go. For those who might be struggling with the APN or who just don't want to hassle with customer service, they give me the following info and it worked: Name: STRAIGHT TALK APN: tfdata MMS APN: tfdata MMSC: [...] MMS proxy: mms3.tracfone.com MMS Port: 80",A.

That being said, I cannot activate it with my Israeli sim, as it keeps popping the ""SIM network unlock PIN"" message, and I do not have a PIN number. I understood that the phone is supposed to be unlocked, but it doesn't seem so. It is very plausible that the problem here is me, not knowing the difference between a sim lock and a device lock, but still I cannot make the phone work, which is very frustrating. Update - It appears that in order for my phone to work internationally, I need to make a ""cumulative call of over five minuted with an American sim"". How am I supposed to do that when I'm 10 flight hours away from America??? Seriously disappointed and unhappy, will probably return it soon if won't find a solution.",Shira,Samsung_S5,7

So I love Apple Computers, and the last decade has been marked by a love and hate relationship with the Apple ecosystem. I think the iPad is a great device (and I DON'T like the Galaxy line of tablets). I really enjoy MacBooks in all sizes and shapes. But the iPhone stopped evolving with the 3GS, and they are now playing catch up with Samsung. The s5 is the game changer. I have been using this phone for a month now and can, without hesitancy, say that this is the best phone on the market. In addition, it is actually cheaper than the iPhone 5S! The speed, the beautiful photography, the performance, the sound - everything is better. The iPhone 5S was a bit clunky and would sometimes randomly scroll on its own. This phone doesn't do that. It is seamless. STEVE JOBS would have preferred this phone. In addition to all the other additions, this phone is indestructable. It can withstand dust storms, rain storms, etc. I have to deal a lot of this as a development worker in Africa. This phone can take it all.","Douglas J. La Rose ""Douglas""",Samsung_S5,14

I left the world of contracts with cell phone providers and went to Straight Talk and this device work great! The features that this telephone offers are tremendous, I especially like the NFC feature to use with 'tap to pay' using Google Wallet. Before this phone, I had an iPhone 5C, and compared to that, this phone has so much more to offer. The one and only problem I have encountered with this phone is that sometimes the screen won't come on when I try to wake the telephone up to use. Other than that, I would recommend it for anyone wanting a smart phone that is user friendly, has great features and is unlocked to use on any carrier you choose.",Michael T.,Samsung_S5,31

I am not a fan of Apple, and have several Samsung products (t.v., computer, DVD player etc) so I thought I would go with the Samsung phone. Glad that Best Buy has a 14 day return policy!!! First off, I chose the phone because the camera specs are much better. Don't believe the hype!!! My Motorola Atrix HD took better pictures. Outside, or in bright light pictures are great, but indoor and closeup pictures are very pixelated, and fuzzy as if you were taking pictures of moving objects (even with the photo stabilizer on). So for those who want to take selfies...forget about it! Next is when is big too big? The 5s is larger than the 4. It is even too large to sit in my cup holder when I am driving, or the one on the treadmill while I am working out. The other thing that is too big...the input jack. I thought head phone jacks were a universal size, but the one on the 5s does not allow you to firmly connect a set of headphones. I assume they expect everyone to use bluetooth phones, or the ones that came with the phone, but those headphones are not as nice as the ones that I se when working out... As far as the phone itself goes, it is a clear signal and I have no issue with blue tooth pairings. So that is good..but if you are buying it for the camera, you will be let down!",George Gray,Samsung_S5,45

I love it. In my house I have a problem getting network signal from different providers. My calls were getting dropped or going directly to voice mail. This phone has a feature that allows it to work with my WiFi as well as the network. My calls are not getting dropped anymore. The camera is outstanding. The photos look great. It has a call reject feature that allows you to block certain numbers such as telemarketers, etc. It has a download booster that allows you to use the network AND your WiFi when you're downloading stuff. But I believe that this feature only works with T-Mobile right now. It has a Finger Scanner that you can use when you unlock your screen as well as to make PayPal payments. It has an Emergency mode that allows you to automatically send an SOS message along with a front and back photo of where you are to up to 3 contacts. That's just a few of the features. But for me the main feature and the reason for buying this phone was the fact that it works with my home's WIFI so my calls don't get dropped anymore, which was extremely annoying.

DO NOT BUY SM-G900H unless you know for fact that you need it for specific countries. For those who roam, thus far both our 2 phones have managed to get 4G whereever we are (when it exists), though in some countries some carriers won't work. For example the US AT&T one won't work fast on Vodaphone Ireland (but will on the other networks), and the Irish one only works on the main Colombian carrier (Claro) (Obviously we have them both unlocked). Also, bear in mind some carriers use multiple bands - varying by area... The H version sold here is trying to be a ""global phone"" matching a huge number of 3G bands - but the price is no 4G support at all, anywhere.

This year Samsung has dominated the Smartphone war between Apple and Samsung. With the new Samsung Galaxy S5, Samsung has become the undisputed king of Smartphone’s while Apple still in a distant second place. The Samsung Galaxy S5 Smartphone has been demanded by people around the world with an approximate of 85 million Smartphone’s in the first quarter of the year. These numbers have are superior than any other competitors to Samsung such as Apple, Huawei, and LG. The Samsung Galaxy S5 carries a 5.1-inch 1080p SAMOLED display at 432ppi, a 16mp rear camera, 32-bit Snapdragon 801 processor, 2GB of RAM, 16 or 32GB of flash storage that can be expandable via MicroSD. In other words, the new Galaxy S5 is the best and most demanded Smartphone in the market. The Samsung galaxy s5 comes with some of the most amazing features that most Smartphone’s are missing. The water and dust resistant body that the S5 provides is one of major features why numerous customers have bought the Smartphone. As a matter of fact, the body the S5has is certified resistant to water with a contact up to one meter in depth for thirty minutes. Another important reason why the new Samsung Galaxy S5 is very resistant to water contact is that it comes with a flap on USB port that ensures the phone is resistant to any accidental water splashes or any accidental submerge. In addition, the Samsung Galaxy S5 comes with one of the first usable finger print sensors ever developed. This new feature makes a well better version of the Galaxy S5 that includes a sensor called the finger scanner that is located in the phones home button. In the same way, Apple’s iPhone 5s has also included a finger print sensor that users only have to swipe their finger and they do not hold it; this creates a bigger gap for any errors of the iPhone’s security. Unlike the iPhone, the Galaxy S5 has the finger print scanner that can be used to make payments via PayPal and lock the phone by holding the sensor to authenticate the finger print. Furthermore, the Samsung Galaxy s5 ports an improved and better quality camera. This new camera has an enhanced sixteen mega pixels rear camera able of record up to 4k video at thirty frames per second. This means the camera is able to take faster and better quality pictures. Samsung Company declares having the fastest auto-focus in the Smartphone industry since the Galaxy S5 takes 0.3 seconds to focus. This new camera also offers a great new feature that has fascinated people. The Galaxy S5 counts with a slow motion video recording feature that allows users see their videos in a new fascinating perspective. In the end, Samsung this year has created their best Smartphone ever. Even though, apple in previous years was the best in creating Smartphone, Samsung won the number one position for the best Smartphone. Without a doubt the Samsung Galaxy s5 is the best Smartphone in the market this 2014.",Brandon Guerrero,Samsung_S5,100

The menu changed but you get used to it is not that complicated. At the beginning I was a little skeptical when I received my phone… I thought it was a fake one, b/c of the plastic cover it had, it can easily break and the duo sim it had, and I read that they only have one!! however I start checking on the web for a looong time finding out if it was original or not! At the end I felt relief cuz in fact it was ORIGINAL it turns out it came from United Emirates that is why it was different, and what I found out it’s that in Emirates they did made phones with duo sims. The other thing it had me worried was about the delivery service, it came thru Lasership and reading all the reviews it said they were terrible! they said my phone would arrive at 8PM at the end it came at 9am! They were really fast! Despite all the negative reviews mine was GOOD! I would recommend to buy from this seller it was fast and you get what they offer.",ms88,Samsung_S5,104

The phone I found most reps using was the S5. HTC was in there as a contender. I decided on the S5, and excitedly plugged it up. Different power connector from my S4. Disappointed, I looked carefully and discovered the S4 charger works fine. Just plug it into the smaller plug of the connector. The larger connector allows a faster charge, but the S5 will plug into a mini USB connector just fine. Sadly, my S5 was DOA out of the box. Verizon replaced it the next day, and this phone has been stellar. I carry a lot of music, so a MicroSD card is indispensable. My phone streams music and pictures to my sound system and TV beautifully. I can control my Samsung TV with my phone, which is cool. I can be in the kitchen and turn the volume up without taking the 8 steps to the other controller. How lazy is that? :) Tons of apps, and a great camera. Fast browsing, easy wi-fi setup, and with the right app quick texting all over the world. Instant texting to Finland from the USA? Tell me that's not an amazing thing we take for granted. The screen is clear and crisp. The keyboard is nice and responsive, touch quick and without lag. Volume, power and other keys and access to headphones and power are reasonably laid out. I usually don't hit keys I don't mean to with my big fingers. As with all smartphones, they will nickel and dime you to death with various services, such as music access and extra cloud storage. The simple answer is that a service might be very cool but is worth $9.99 a month? Customer service. We all hate dealing with customer service. It's important to remember that the poor rep doesn't set prices, make policy, or manufacture the phone personally. It'll be frustrating enough dealing with a Samsung rep without adding anything. Wrong answers, 'I'm not sure', being put on hold forever and unreadable emails is enough to deal with. Avoid hot drinks and sharp objects when dealing with them. You'll want something to protect your very pricy phone. The S5 is rated to withstand immersion in liquid at a couple of feet for a short amount of time. If you have the power connect cover on properly and it falls off your shoulder and into the dish water you should be fine. Pretend you won't and be careful. I use a Puregear case and screen protector. My personal advice is to avoid Otterbox. I tried Otterbox on Kindle Fire HDX, it didn't fit, and dealing with their customer service has been a nightmare. Problems range from forgotten emails with the link to the return page to being told I didn't buy it directly from Otterbox so they wouldn't help me. Funny, my invoice says Otterbox.com and that their Otters were packing and shipping it right out. I finally told them to have the otters give me a call. They can't be any worse and might be better. Overall, I'd say you'll really enjoy your new S5. If you have friends with S5s you can use things like GroupPlay for games and actually share cameras. Things run so smoothly you'll be surprised if something doesn't. Isn't that a nice change? It'll take some time to figure all the toys out, you might want to get a tips and tricks manual. You can get them here on Amazon. I have found myself using my phone for everything, I only break out my tablet and laptop when I need the heavy duty stuff.

Santa is real. You'll get a job after college. And your Galaxy 5 phone with OtterBox is waterproof. But these are all lies. I know because my Galaxy 5 phone with OtterBox got wet this weekend. When I bought this phone, I was told tall tales that this phone can stay underwater 17 minutes. I was told OtterBox had a lifetime guarantee. Yet when I called both companies, they explain their products are only ""water resistant."" I explained their product couldn't resistant a sneezing child, but there was nothing these multimillion dollars companies could do. When I think about the failure of our country, I often say the problem is we put policy over people. We lie to sell. We hold no accountability. And our greatness dies at the bottom dollar. This is one situation, but all of us have experienced the death of America through the failure of costumer service. They don't need us, yet they have made it almost impossible to leave them. None of this matters. Even with insurance, I'll have to pay. I'll get a new phone and I'll continue with my life. But this is where our country has gone. Greed is more important than pride. And no matter how hard you work, there will always be a cooperation willing to screw you over. Today, it was Galaxy 5 and Otterbox. Tomorrow, who knows...",Michael Dunker,Samsung_S5,235

I sent my phone for repair to their Texas service center(they dont have local service centers), They sent back my phone in 2 days but with incomplete address. My phone is lost since 1 month ,No apology, No regret , they don't even own responsibility.The statement from one agent ""We are here to troubleshoot, not to track packages"". Broken process , they sent back the phone just with my Name and City i live in , They missed my street address. Cant imagine how can a company which sells 4 billion worh of phones in a quarter is living with such a broken process. I think the fun begins when you start talking to their representative , They don't have any idea whats the status of my Ticket. Looks like they can just store data like fixed or Not, nothing more. I have to start to explain my problem every time i call in, it takes an hour for them to figure out the problem. I don't think they show any emotional connection to customers. I usually feel valued as a customs when i speak with so called big companies like Apples, Microsoft and Amazons. They want to fix your problem then and there and keep you satisfied. When i asked Samsung that you lost my phone and i don't have a phone since 1 month, they just say your phone is under warranty , we are doing investigation. I think Apple or Amazon would have sent me a new phone immediately if i report them their blunder. Here i am moving from pillar to post , wasting hours and hours of time and finally don't get a simple response.",FairStar,Samsung_S5,255

Well very loud audio and a bright screen. The cons, well here they are: The cover for the battery compartment is cheap and only snaps on the body. The cover for the data port opens by itself. The optional carry case does not allow for a belt clip so you must carry it in your pocket. The screen is flat with the front panel so the plastic protective cover lays on top of the phone. Unlike my Razr Maxx, the edges are exposed which in time will cause the edges to curl up. My much hated Razr Maxx has had the protective cover on for 2 years and you don't know it's there. Worse of all, the supplied keyboard is smaller in horizontal mode than the Razr Maxx. Now I ask you, why make the battery replaceable? No one will keep a Smart phone for more than 2 years anyway. My Motorola Razr Maxx is 2 years old and runs for 4 days on a charge. Granted I am not on it 24/7. Unless you have Eagle eyes, this is a bad phone. I hate apple and their iPhone crap. So why does Samsung have to make a phone smaller, thinner and lighter than the newest iPhone? Hell my Motorola Razr weighs 9.5 oz. If I can't carry that, what are we coming to. My suggestion, go to a Verizon, AT&T or Walart and see the phone in person BEFORE you buy online. Mu new phone is going back to Verizon. While I hate the Motorola Razr, I can live without the 490.00 expense and another 2 years contract. To you phone manufacturers, small is NOT always better. Try making a phone with some substance. For now, I will keep my Razr.",L. M. Celani,Samsung_S5,391

Apps like S Health are now more focused than ever and the heart rate sensor is great thing even though tech reviewers try to play it off as a gimmick - this phone has literally made me want to be more active since I purchased it, the biometric scanner is a great addition as well that works perfectly for me 8/10 times. Also great news is that upon typing this I found out that micro usb chargers still work with this phone (it's a USB 3.0 port that can also use a micro usb). No BS Apple move. The feel of the phone is the best of the series. Yes it's plastic but it is definitely more upscale feeling to the touch while maintaining a light weight, and aesthetically both the front and back look great. The screen is the best I've ever seen on a smartphone, crisp, colorful, and bright. The camera is an important feature for me and I'm happy to say it doesn't disappoint - it's fast, takes great photos, the live HDR mode is awesome as well. The only thing i'm not sold on is the 16:9 aspect ratio being the only mode at 16mp. You can do a standard 4:3 aspect but at 12mp. But still not necessarily bad since mega pixels don't mean much compared to the actual sensor used. The speaker is loud and clear, reception for both the phone and wifi is great too. Better than my S3 with the 4.3 update, on that note Kit Kat is awesome! One last note, the IP67 rating/ water resistance and dust resistance is an amazing and welcome feature. In summation: If you're coming from an S3 then your contract is probably up this year, and this is an amazing upgrade to a phone I loved. It really wasn't even a question for me. Size, aesthetics, features, adding your own memory, and still being able to replace your own battery made this a clear choice over the HTC M8, and others.",Mo,Samsung_S5,397

When the HTC one m8 came out I was positive that was the phone for me, I was very unimpressed with its camera. When thever s5 came out, I was disappointed in the gimmicks Samsung took with the phone. However, there are so many features on this phone that truly do improve the experience. Customizing the operating system is fantastic, and many of the internal software features come in handy often. I actually have grown to like the one handed use feature which shrinks the screen to what ever side your tub is on. Samsung does include useless other features, but they all work as advertised. The camera is fantastic, I had an 8 mp camera on my last phone and this is truly better. Plus many of the features on the camera are fun and very useful. In deciding which phone to choose the camera was one of the most important to me and I am happy with the performance of this one. Anyone who reads this should know that buying a flagship device will most often be an improvement over previous devices. I owned a motorola Droid bionic for 2 years, it served me well, but going from that to my Shiney GS5 feels like I moved from a record player to an ipod, or a pinto to a Lamborghini, or apartment to mansion. If you are moving off a two year contract like I did, any flagship device will be a vast improvement, justhe find features that are important to you and decide from there. As a side note, I'm finding the battery life is excellent, batteries themselves have not changedone much, but management of power usage has and the gs5 manages the power exceptionally. Watching Netflix for over an hour and a half lost me about 5 percent of my battery.",Joseph Johnson,Samsung_S5,398

The charging port has a door, which is located at the bottom of the phone. This makes it impossible to use any type of charging dock with the exception of a wireless dock, which by the time you get a new back for the phone and the charging pad, is another $100. I would pay the money, but that also means that I can't use a case for the phone unless I take it out of the case every time I charge. On the bright side, the camera in this phone totally rocks. It has downloadable effects (filters) that you can use, the capibilities are endless. I like the ""private"" mode and the ""kids"" mode. Both work with the fingerprint scanner. Private mode allows you to put things like your Christmas shopping list, or photos etc, in an area that no one else can tell is even there. Kids mode allows you to choose what the child has access to. The camera filters for children are adorable! They have age related games for children of all ages as well. What a plus when trying to keep a child busy or quiet in an unexpected situation! Charging is quick and the battery life is good...yesterday I went the entire day using only 18% of the battery...went to bed with 82% left. Not bad in comparison to the S3 I had. On the whole, I totally recommend this phone....its pretty cool :-)",Amazon Customer,Samsung_S5,399

It has top of the line specs and most all the features you could ever want in a phone. Yet the overall experience is lacking. I bought this phone for a few reasons: Expandable storage, optional inductive charging, and water resistance. This is the only phone on Verizon to offer all of this. Physically, this phone is light although a bit large for the screen size compared to the LG G2 and Nexus 5. I have read this is due to the water resitance. If so, it's a compromise I can live with. The back of the black (dark charcoal) one is dimpled and slightly soft-touch, which I like. The white one I looked at in the store was NOT soft touch. I haven't seen this mentioned anywhere else. There is a plastic chrome strip going around the outside. Normally I don't mind chrome, but the ridged edge on the S5, combined with the plastic chrome volume and power button and dimpled back looks tacky. There is also a door you need to pry up to access the USB port. I don't mind because I like the water resistance and plan on getting an inductive charging back for it. It generally looks nice, but not nearly as nice as most of its competitors. It doesn't creak and make noise when handling as Samsungs have been known to in the past. Online drop tests seem to indicate it is a durable design, so personally I don't really care about how ""premium"" it looks. I much prefer a grippy soft touch plastic to slippery metal that is prone to scratches. The home button/print scanner is a physical button rather than capacitive. At first I didn't think I'd like it, but then I realized it also turns it on which is nice. I still don't know if I like it, but I don't mind. There are also capacitive back and multitask buttons along the bottom. I do wish they weren't invisible when not lit up and swapped like on other Android phones, but I am glad they are there rather than just having on-screen buttons that take up screen space like on the Nexus 5. The screen looks nice. Frankly, I think 1080 screens are overated and find 720 screens just as nice. I don't hold the phone up to my nose after all. In regular use, I don't find the resolution to be much if any improvement over my old EVO qHD screen. Brightness and color are much better though. On to the features. The main selling points of this phone over others seem to be the water resistance, heartrate monitor, and fingerprint scanner. The heartrate monitor requires you to be still and quiet. In other words, it's pretty useless and should not factor into your decision at all. The water resistance is a great feature I think every phone should have. I don't plan on torture testing it but there are videos online of it surviving an hour under water, a pot of boiling water, and a washing machine. This is an important feature for me as I spend a lot of time outdoors. The fingerprint scanner is good enough that I continue to use it. I have both thumbs and a finger set up. It would be nice to have one more finger available to use to cover all the ways I hold the phone. It's a bit picky that you swipe straight down, keep contact with the button, and don't go too fast. But once you get it down it works OK. What really lets this phone down is Samsung's TouchWiz interface. While it offers a lot of features, some more useful than others, it is also laggy, clumsy, arguably ugly and overall just not an elegant interface. Yes, I can use a launcher or root it or whatever, but then I'd lose the features it offers. Two years ago that kind of thing was acceptable on Android, but I don't feel it is today. There's no getting around the lag. I don't understand how anybody can claim it doesn't lag. Scrolling is often not smooth. There is a slight pause every time you select something. All around you will find random stutters and jitters. The camera is especially bad, often taking 6-7 seconds to snap a picture when first starting up. This is not an Android thing as the MotoX, G2, One M8 and Nexus 5 all do not suffer from thi",P. Lundberg,Samsung_S5,400

Great performance. 3. Battery life has been improved. 4. Improved design. 5. Premium camera with lots of features. Cons- 1. The interface still feels cluttered. 2. A lot of bloatware and redundancy. 3. Only 16 GB of internal storage. Having used the Samsung Galaxy S5 for over a month the best description I can use for it is that is it a jack of all trades. This is a phone that does everything really, really well but it is not the best at any one thing. The phone itself is fantastic and I hope this review will help you decide whether it is right one for you. DISPLAY The Galaxy family of phones has always had very attractive displays. The Galaxy S5 is no exception. The screen has a 1920 x 1080 resolution with a pixel density of 432. This makes texts and pictures incredibly sharp. It is very useful for people that like to read a lot on their phones. No more blurry texts. But it is not the resolution that makes the display special but the fact that it is a Super AMOLED screen. What does that mean? Well Super AMOLED have very saturated colors that look beautiful. The colors look slightly unrealistic but there is no denying that they are attractive. AMOLED screens also has higher contrast than its competition. Compare a Galaxy S5 screen to an LG or HTC and you will instantly notice the difference. It really makes pictures and videos come to life. The only thing I do not like about the display is that it is not very bright. If you are under direct sunlight you have to increase the brightness all the way up in order to distinguish anything. Even then videos are very difficult to watch under sunlight. PERFORMANCE The Galaxy S5 comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor and 2 GB of Ram. This phone comes with latest version of android which is Kit Kat 4.4.2. This is the most secure, stable, and smooth version of android. The processor makes the phone feel fast and the phone can handle just about everything that you throw at it. With this phone you don’t have to worry about how many applications you have opened or whether or not it is going to freeze. Samsung has been refining and perfecting multitasking the last few years. In the S5 you can run two applications at the same time without any lag or stutters. I have 4 home screens with 5 widgets running at the same time and I still can’t get this phone to lag. As far as gaming is concerned, you can be confident that this phone can handle any game available in the Play Store right now without any problem. Games load fast and the performance is very smooth. I have absolutely no complains about performance. DESIGN The Galaxy S5 is made of plastic. There is no way around that. However, the back texture of the phone is much better than the one found on the S4, S3, and S2. Those phones were fingerprint magnets. After a few minutes of use without a case they would become an oily mess. That is not the case with the S5. The S5 does not collect fingerprint. The back of the device has a dimple texture that has grown on me. I am not a huge fan of the color selection of the phone but the navy blue model looks great. The phone has a 5.1 inch display. The phone is pretty big. One handed use is not impossible but it is hard. I am a fan of the fingerprint scanner on the S5. What I don’t like is the fact that you have to slide your finger in order to scan your finger. The IPhone 5S version of the fingerprint sensor is much more convenient when you are using the phone with one hand. The phone itself is comfortable to hold for long periods of time and it provides a pretty good grip. I am using the phone without a case and I don’t fear dropping the phone. I was using an LG G2 a few months ago and I was terrified of holding it without a case. It was much more slippery. Another improvement the S5 has over the S4 is that it is now water and dust resistant. The back plate has a thin rubber border on the inside that prevents water from coming in. Now the phone is NOT water proof. I",DP21,Samsung_S5,401

He is also REALLY attached to the physical Qwerty keyboard of his old Env3 type flip phone (Env3 in 2014? See what I mean?) especially for text messaging (usually to YELL AT ME IN ALL CAPS!) So imagine my surprise the morning the Galaxy S5 launched, to be awakened FOUR Hours before Verizon even opens to be told WE ARE GETTING S5s. Seriously? WE?! It's MY account. We? I've been holding out 2.5 years for Motorola to get off its behind for the Droid 5, WE are getting S5s? Did I mention that my Archie Bunker has a partially paralyzed hand AND peripheral neuropathy? He has very limited sensation in his hands.... I'm smelling disaster. Four whole hours. Til Verizon opens. We get breakfast. We stalk Verizon. After the kind store manager gave us an S5 to play with for awhile, I reluctantly ordered a black and white matched pair. Grreat. Now I had all weekend to await the arrival of my dreamship while fear began to engulf me. What have I done?! What am I thinking?! We are talking about my Archie Bunker here (no! I am most certainly NOT Edith!) The phones arrived. We're activated. I set up his Google account and calendar (forgetting all about his stored contacts on his ancient phone...), and began hunting down the most crucial apps and laying out his desktop in an orderly fashion - Gmail, clean sweep, advanced task killer, the weather channel, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Hulu+, TED, Kindle, etc. Widgets, can't forget those! I also installed a screen protector and leather case. (hint: have your technomage spouse or technogeek grandkids do this for Archie types!) It was time to turn him loose. I cringed in fear. A month has now lapsed. I'm ready to write this review. Wow. Despite the hand issues, he has figured out ways to make the touch screen respond appropriately. He's become a regular on Facebook, even at 3am from bed! His adult kids are angered because he stopped communicating as much (note: we eventually realized the S5 shows ACCOUNT names on incoming calls, when he sees his 'ex-wife' calling he obviously isn't answering lol!) and without that physical keyboard he's all but forgotten texting exists... Even to reply to me. ::sigh:: But what has he learned to do?! His LinkedIn is now over 1200 connections, he's all over Facebook day and night even from the car (passenger of course) and waiting rooms, hitting Like hours before even I see the post! He's found the camera, our poor German Shepherd Dog now cringes at the sound of the 'shutter' click knowing that bright flash is blinding! Poor Aiko! At least Daddy hasn't yet been posting his candid furball mugs all over Facebook (that's my job!) He's so attached to his S5 it goes with him everywhere! Even to his metal desk in the basement, which remains our cell phone black hole... So if you experienced dead zones with other phones that likely won't change. If my knight in shining armor can survive his first month on an S5, so can yours. I highly recommend the S5, even for those with moderate hand disabilities.","Jeri Zerr ""formerly a Road Warrior of the Nth Degree""",Samsung_S5,402

It took me a while to debate between the two phones, but here is what eventually sold me on the Galaxy S5: -Wireless charging option. I plan on getting the replacement back cover and a wireless charger for my desk, as well as a wireless charging car dock -Camera. Higher Megapixels and faster focusing. Low light is still not great, but an improvement. This phone takes pictures very quickly. -Fingerprint scanner. Not as convenient as on the iphone, but still a nice way to unlock the phone. -Battery is replaceable and of significant mAH. -IP67 rating Here are some other thoughts: -I liked the HTC one M8's dual front speakers, but it added a significant length to the phone, which frankly, all these phones are on the large side already. -I like the aluminum back of the M8, but I know that I would scratch it quickly, it doesn't allow for wireless charging, and is not easily replaceable. In this regard, I actually like that the S5 has a plastic back that is replaceable. -Both HTC and Samsung has some nifty software features with their own flare, and Kit Kat is also nice - on both phones. -the infrared port is fun to play with to control the tv and bluray player, and works quite well. I do plan on adding a tempered glass cover to try out and see how well it works. I am undecided about cases, especially since I intend on wirelessly charging, and the replacement back cover isn't available yet, and most likely will add some thickness. I want to get the wireless charging cover before I look for cases. With the Qi standard, it should be able to charge through the thickness of the case. One reason why I want to wirelessly charge, is to keep the USB 3 door cover closed at all times to retain the IP67 rating, and not have to worry about that as well as wearing out the charging port. Other factors that I generally like about the S5, but were not the deciding factors: -heartbeat sensor -usb 3, faster transfers if I directly connect the phone to the computer, as well as compatibility with a greater number of cables (both 2.0 as well as 3.0 now) -All current wireless standards (including mimo for ac, dual band, etc.) -2.5 Ghz processor The Galaxy S5 is not THE best in every aspect (I wish it had a better speaker, more abilities from the lock screen, came stock with the wireless charging back, more Ram, etc.), but it is excellent (if not the best) in many areas, and overall for me, was the best option and compromise from what is currently is available. I keep my phones for at least 2 years (my last phone was the Droid Razr MAXX), and I expect to be able to hold on to this phone for at least that length of time considering the features of the S5, especially the battery which tends to be the shortest lasting part of any phone.",gnef,Samsung_S5,403

It just happens to charge really really quickly if you use a USB 3.0 cable, but it's not necessary to do so. AMAZING SCREEN This display is nicer than any I have ever seen. It is so sharp I cannot see individual pixels with my naked eye. It's also bright, very bright! It's perfectly usable on a bright sunny day at noon without a cloud in the sky. In really bright conditions, the screen boosts the maximum allowable brightness when the auto-brightness feature enabled! So if it's extremely bright outside, leave the auto-brightness feature enabled. Unlike in previous iterations, it is superbly implemented anyway, so I'd recommend leaving it on regardless. I upgraded from the S3, and I immediately noticed the 1080P resolution, the whiter whites, darker blacks, extremely realistic and still vibrant colors, and even the capability of dimming the screen much more effectively (which is really nice when using the phone in bed). The Super AMOLED screen seems to have been perfected in this device! You have to see it to believe it, this is a stunningly beautiful 1080P display that knocks the competition out of the park. The size of the screen is a big plus in my opinion, as well and is especially fantastic given its... CONVENIENT MULTITASKING CAPABILITIES You can run two programs on the screen at the same time, in a split window arrangement. The really fast processing ensures that doing so doesn't cause lags. Even with two apps sharing the screen, the phone's operation is butter smooth. And the 5 inch display means that you have plenty of real estate for both apps. INSANELY AWESOME ULTRA-POWER SAVING MODE This thing is for real. With 10 percent power left, you get usability the rest of the day. The S5 has a super amoled screen, so black pixels don't draw any power as opposed to back-lit LCD screens in which a black pixel is really just a pixel in which the backlight has been blocked. Ultra-power saving mode turns the screen black and white, and gives you a jet-black interface with up to six black and white icons. This means that a tiny fraction of the pixels are powered. This mode also reduces the screen frame rate, shuts down two of the phone's four cores, reduces in half the speed of the remaining two cores, shuts down almost all background processes, disables most apps, and sips power all the while letting you text, call, and surf the web. You can check your email via the web, but can't use the email or gmail apps. Basically it turns your phone into one of those old brick phones that lasted forever. That's pretty sweet in a pinch! At 100% power, activating ultra-power saving mode gives you 12 DAYS of standby time! I figure with regular use I'd get a week. You could literally charge your phone to 100% before a week-long vacation, flip on ultra power-saving mode, use your phone normally (calling, texting, and some web surfing) and probably make it the entire week without having to charge it. I'd love to test that theory. But suffice it to say that gone are the days of needing to worry about a dead phone when you're out all day and don't have access to a charger. THE SECURITY OF A FINGERPRINT SCANNER It takes some getting used to, but once you set up your fingerprints, you can easily activate the phone by swiping your finger or thumb (I set mine up for one-handed use using my thumb, and after a week, it registers on the first try just about every time). No one else can access my phone and should I try and fail to unlock the phone too many times, I can then enter a password to unlock it. I had to do that a few times the first day of use. But with frequent use, I quickly learned to unlock my phone on the first attempt. I am a huge fan of the fingerprint scanner. IR BLASTER I can use the IR blaster to operate my TV.

Instead of boring you with facts - which you can find anywhere on the Net - I will just give you some real-world impressions on how it looks, feels, and runs. With that out of the way, let's get to the point and the nitty gritty, shall we? * THE SCREEN - that is the very first thing you will notice when you look at the S5. Samsung has found its niche with AMOLED screens, which are BRIGHT & SATURATED. Everything almost literally jumps out at you, and sometimes even too much so. I had to switch to the ""natural"" setting, as the ""vivid"" and even ""standard"" profiles are too saturated(and FAKE) for me. It's better as a demo unit to draw you in, but for everyday use, I recommend switching to the natural profile. FACTS: The Galaxy S5 has a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with Full HD resolution - 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~432 ppi pixel density, plus Gorilla Glass 3 to protect the screen from scratches. * The Look - the S5 has a more squared-off edges look than the S4, which is more squared off than the S3, but all three are not as angular as the S2. In terms of roundness-to square-ness, it goes from the S3 - S4 - S5 - S2 (the original S just looks like an iPhone 3GS). Check out my images for an easier comparison. The S5 is the tallest and widest, but not the thickest of the Galaxy S's. The best thing I can say about this is it's an evolution. Beauty is subjective, so judge for yourself. The front side is almost the same as any other Galaxy phone: You have the physical Home button, flanked by the ""back"" and ""menu"" capacitive buttons. Probably the most improved aspect of the design is in its functionality - it is now dust-proof, and water-proof up to 3 feet! FACTS: The dimensions are 5.59"" x 2.85"" x 0.32""(142cm x 72.5cm x 8.1cm), and weighs 5.11oz(145g). * The Feel - Samsung has taken a lot of flack for making the Galaxy S line so cheap looking and feeling with its plastic bodies, for being the top Android phone maker. HTC has been known to have the best craftsmanship with their all-metal One phones. Perhaps Samsung feel they are so dominant that they don't have to spend more to mass-produce metal phones, but since they don't want to come off as too arrogant, so their compromise is a dimpled, faux-rubber backside like the Nexus 7(2012) and its very own Galaxy Note 3. It definitely gives a better feel - it doesn't slip and slide in your hands or pockets anymore - but it cannot compare to the feel and craftsmanship of the HTC One(both the m7 and m8). It is on the right track though, so let's hope that rumored luxury ""F"" line or next year's S6 will continue to get better. * How it Runs - This phone is fast, fast, FAST! With a 2.5gHz Snapdragon 801, it has the fastest processor out there right now. It terms of real speed, I cannot say if it is faster than the HTC One m8 or the Sony Xperia Z2, but it is definitely up there. When you touch an app icon to launch it, it launches nearly instantly. To really see how this phone flies, just open the gallery app and scroll through all your photos and you'll see what I mean. Usually the gallery is where most phones stutter as it tries to load all your photos and albums - but NOT the S5! * The Camera - FINALLY! Samsung has decided to make a decent camera, and not just as an afterthought. This 16mp camera is really awesome, so much better than the S4. I would always get washed out images with my S3/S4/Note 2, but with the S5, it actually looks like it's from a decent point-and-shoot dedicated camera with crisp, bright, and saturated images. Low-light shooting is also vastly improved, although not as good as the new HTC One m8. 16mp means 5312 x 2988 -resolution images, so you can actually blow them up or crop them down without fearing the dreaded pixelation monster. There are a myriad of other cool and useful camera features that I will save for you to find out(like macro and ""Google",Johnny Saigon®,Samsung_S5,405

Durability - I relied on the professionals to test the durability (cnet, etc.). However I do know that the phone is at least as durable as the S3 which I dropped on the concrete several times at 3' to 5' and the gorilla glass never broke and the phone worked normal, also used it in the rain with no problems. The phone is one of the most durable excluding construction phones available. 2. Signal strength - the same as most phones, only older non smart phones that have extended antennas and phones that allowed you to connect to signal boosters and external antennas will get you a better signal. 3. Voice Quality - Tried speakerphone, Bluetooth, headset and regular mic. everyone I spoke to told me the voice clarity was very good. On my end I found the volume a little on the low side and had to use the increased volume option in a noisy environment. 4. Camera - The quality of the picture in still - auto mode, panorama and movie mode is excellent. The delay people experience is the camera compensating for the environment so you get a good quality picture. The picture quality in my opinion rivals a good non-professional digital camera. 5. Screen - Screen size is one of the largest available on a cell phone. Screen clarity is amazing and you can even see images and use the key pad in direct sunlight a great improvement from older phones. 6. Surfing the internet - I tested the phone on WIFI and received up to 57mbs. (The fastest speed my provider had), the phone processor is as fast as a good computer. People that complain about the connection speed in my opinion are having a carrier problem not a problem with this phone. 7. Heart beat monitor - Yes it works, but it is very sensitive and you may have to re-take the measurement several times. 8. Music - no problems with clarity. 8. Battery Life - Over 24 hours with ""normal"" usage. Normal being texting, music, voice, camera in still mode, use. 9. Overall Impression: Very well constructed, options work as advertised. I believe you will have a hard time finding a better quality phone. In my opinion the only real negative was the volume during calls; it was ""ok"" but in my opinion should be a little louder in normal mode.",Oldtech 45,Samsung_S5,406

There are power saving options including the ""Ultra"" option but that defeats the purpose of the phone. It limits usable apps and leaves the display screens with a dull background. If I wanted that I wouldn't have bought this phone. The thing is the galaxy 5 really is not a phone, it is a very small tablet. It works like a tablet, looks like a tablet and Verizon bills you as it would a tablet. Be very careful with the plan you choose. Once you go over the Gig limit it costs $15.00 for each additional gig used. I booked for 2g at $90.00 per month but quickly called customer service and upped it to 5g at the same price. The people in the stores are not these to help....trust me on this. Moral of this story...stay on WIFI when possible. The last thing is an industry wide problem. Build better batteries. With the way people depend on these things and at a retail price of $600.00 Samsung and the rest should come up with a higher capacity battery. Not everyone has time to charge their phones every few hours. My advice....buy a portable battery pack so you can charge all of your tech toys at any time. Ladies the batteries I am referring to are small, are high capacity and fit in your bag so you can charge while on the go. Guys...we have to make do with pockets. Okay, to wrap this up....Be very careful with your price plan and buy an external battery because there is very little chance this unit makes it through the day.",cifrank,Samsung_S5,407

I have had an iPhone for 3 years 2. I have had an iPad for same three years 3. When I discovered that the iPad, when hooked up to my computer, would not act like a USB device, i.e. an external hard drive, I replaced it with #4 4. Got a Samsung Tab and tossed the iPad. Actually, gave it to my niece who thinks it is the cat's meow. 5. Got Samsung S5 to replace the equally bad iPhone, because the S5 is more versatile and can download ANY music or other files. 6. iPhone is tied to iTunes so is severely limited in types of files it can download. The bottom line is that Samsung S5 and Tab are much more flexible than any Apple products, and I recommend them over Apple any day.

I just call it like I see it and Samsung does some tech things better than Apple, and Samsung does NOT force its customers to use an exclusive service like iTunes.",Walter GrumpyOldGuy Sabian,Samsung_S5,409

There were several key improvements that made the switch worthwhile. 1. Waterproofing. I'm a photojournalist and occasionally get caught in the rain. I'm reassured that my expensive phone won't get trashed even if I get soggy as a flounder. Also, do you know how many people drop their phones in toilets, pools or puddles? It's a LOT! You need to seal the charging port with an annoying little flap at the bottom, though, which makes finding a desktop charging cradle problematic. 2. Larger / better screen. I'm a big guy and really like a decent-sized phone. Plus I use Google Maps while driving so a tiny screen just doesn't cut it. The S5 screen is slightly larger and sharper than the excellent S3 screen; great for reading eBooks and watching movies and useable even in daylight. 3. Astonishing battery life! When I first bought the S5, I was lucky to get a full day off a charge. But in September there was a big firmware update (4.4.4). Whatever they did increased the battery life dramatically! I leave just about everything running, yet an astonishing 80-90% battery power remains after 14 hours! Furthermore the new ""Ultra Power Saving Mode"" is an emergency option that shuts down all but the basic communication functions while extending the last gasp of battery life for DAYS. This could be a literal life saver. The S5 charges faster with its new USB 3 charger, but it also charges with standard legacy USB 2 chargers. No funky adapter needed; REALLY nice engineering tweak! 4. Camera. The camera in the new S5 is far better than the S3's camera. I was startled at its quality and ability to shoot under low light. 5. Snappy operation / Using Verizon. The new processor makes the S5 a bit snappier than the S3. Sometimes I use Verizon's Mobile Office to link my laptop to the internet when working in the field. Verizon is awfully expensive, but they have a superior system, especially during emergencies like hurricanes and power outages. Lesson verified during Ike and Katrina. CONS: Of course, Verizon loads their usual loathsome crapware on your new phone; this junk cannot be uninstalled. Furthermore, Samsung felt free to shovel its own steaming pile on top of Verizon's. And watch out for the Google+ app. One setting automatically uploads your photos into the cloud, which can be disastrous away from WiFi on a limited data plan. Neat phone, though, with some spiffy advanced software. Many of the software upgrades are useless, but I quite like the feature that keeps the screen active if it ""sees"" your face with the front camera. Also, I like the NFC sensor. I bought a five-pack of Samsung's TecTiles and downloaded the free ""NFC Task Launcher"" to program the tiles to perform various tedious tasks--like turning off WiFi and turning on Bluetooth when getting into the car. Another one fires up Google Maps while boosting screen brightness. The S3 is a fine device, so don't feel you must upgrade. But the S5 has several distinct improvements and, if you cell plan allows, it is worth it.","Amazon Customer ""hotdog""",Samsung_S5,410

One of the selling points is that the phone is water and dust resistant. The USB port comes with a little flap plug attached to the phone by a rubber or plastic pin. To charge the phone, this plug is pulled aside, then replaced after charging. In less than two months, the plug attachment broke. Calls to Verizon resulted in the following: They told me I needed to contact Samsung directly. I told them that I did not buy the phone from Samsung. They agreed to call Samsung directly while I was on hold. When they came back on, they told that Samsung said that this problem was phone damage and not manufacturer defect. The fix would be done at my cost. Verizon said that they would change me $300 if I sent the phone back to them. I don't believe this dust cover is critical to the enjoyment of the phone, but it is discouraging to think that Samsung should sell a phone for $600 with such a manufacturer defect, and that Verizon refused to go to bat for a customer.",Lawrence Adams,Samsung_S5,411

I switched from the iphone 4s and am very happy. I was nervous about switching since I have been a long time iphone user but I can say from what I have experienced so far I feel confident I made the right choice. So far I have found a few little things that have made me really enjoy the switch. The obvious screen size and resolution on the Galaxy S5 are a huge upgrade from the iphone. The camera and video quality is also far superior on the Galaxy S5. The keyboard that appears when entering text is highly superior to the outdated iphone version. It may sound small but it is one of my favorite features. The keyboard has numbers across the top which saves me time from jumping from an alpha keyboard to a number keyboard, which is extremely helpful when entering passwords etc. Also you have the ability to access other characters such as commas, questions marks, dollar sign, @, and colon from the main keyboard by holding down the corresponding letter, which is another huge time saver. The auto correct and suggestions based on what you are typing is much better - it is easier to select suggestions, the suggestions are more relevant and also include previous entires such as email addresses, and it is easier to decline the suggestions or auto-corrections. A few other small things that I really enjoyed was the ease of manipulating photos for wallpaper/background. I have trouble cropping and using an image on my iphone but was easily able to accomplish it on the Galaxy. I also found the alarms much easier to set, customize, and create a recurring schedule for. I haven't gotten to test everything yet and I do have to set up and get used to using Double Twist (downloaded app) to replace itunes for my music but so far I am so happy with my switch from an iphone. Obviously people have different needs, opinions, and biases on what they want in a phone but I am very happy with the features and ease of use of the Galaxy S5 over the iphone.","Matt 55 ""MC""",Samsung_S5,412

There are plenty of positive reviews that reflect what a solid phone Samsung has built. I'd like to address some of the special merits this phone has now that I've spent a couple weeks with it. *I'm upgrading from a Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, therefore I can't speak to what makes this phone different from previous versions.* 1. Expandable storage - Yes, the phone only comes with 16GB of internal storage. I use a 32GB card and have no space problems with all of my favorite apps installed. Almost all apps that I've downloaded can be moved to the card. I also use it to store photos and videos. All of my music is stored in Google's Play Music cloud. 2. Removable battery - This is a unique feature now that I find helpful. It's worth it to buy a back up battery that you keep charged for times when you don't have access to a charger or an outlet. This is especially useful for long trips. I've found that with moderate use the battery lasts about a day and a half after a full charge. 3. Disabling apps - Android phones notoriously come loaded up with software, both from the manufacturer and the carrier. Between Samsung and Verizon there are probably a dozen apps that I don't need. Samsung has a feature that allows you to disable apps you don't use. Although it doesn't remove the app from the phone, it removes it from the app drawer and prevents it from running in the background. Out of sight, out of mind for me. 4. Fingerprint scanner/heart rate monitor - Okay, these are definitely more on the gimmick side of things and not phone essentials. However, when used correctly both can be useful. I do high intensity interval training and heart rate is a major part of that. I have a Polar heart rate monitor that I use, and I found that the phone is incredibly accurate for measuring BPM by comparing results from the two. There is a companion app called S-health that allows you to keep track of diet and exercise. In an increasingly health conscious world I find that very helpful. The fingerprint scanner is a good layer of security, but make no mistake, if someone is determined to get in your phone they will find a way. It's more of a safeguard just like having a password would be. 5. Vibrant launcher (Touchwiz) with lots of customization - Having owned a few Androids the one thing that always bothered me was the ""coldness"" of the launchers they typically come with. This phone is very colorful and that makes my eyes happy. It's evident that Samsung put a lot of thought into the design of this phone from a software perspective. If you prefer the simplicity of pure Android you'll want to install a custom launcher (there are quite a few awesome ones for free in the Play store) or root the phone. 6. It's made of plastic - I immediately put a case on my phone so I honestly don't care what it's made out of. The hardware in this phone far outweighs the material the back cover is made from. However, if aesthetics are a huge concern for you it may not be to your tastes. 7. Battery saver - This phone has a couple power saving options. One of these options converts the phone to gray scale and severely limits the amount of processes running to prolong the battery life for days. This is a great feature for people who need their phone on, but don't want to waste battery juice when charging won't be an option for a long time. 8. Easy mode/blocking mode/private mode - Each one does vastly different things, and it speaks to the fact that Samsung is appealing to all types of users. Easy mode for people who don't want their smartphone to be TOO smart, blocking mode for turning off pesky notifications during certain times (e.g., turn off phone ringing between certain hours except for certain contacts), and private mode for securing your phone just a bit more. None of these options are on by default so if you don't want to use them, you don't have to. I really like that Samsung bake",Haley,Samsung_S5,413

After reading and watching all the reviews, it came down to priorities. With anything, you have to know what you want out of it and how you're going to use it. For me, there were a few things I knew I wanted my next phone to have. 1. Removable battery 2. Good battery life 3. Great camera 4. Fast processor for web browsing 5. Android OS (used to it) Though I looked into all of the top phones to see what they all offered, most of them were eliminated by falling short in one or more areas of my list. They are nice phones but were not what I was looking for. I was pretty quickly able to cross off the HTC One M8, Droid Maxx, Nokia Lumina and iPhone (have one as a work phone) for one or more reasons. That left the Galaxy S5 and LG G3. These are the premier heavyweights on the android market right now. I was back and forth on these 2 repeatedly until the S5 edged it out with a brighter display, narrower frame (I have small hands) and durability by way of water and dust resistance. I never once thought about what was popular or stylish. I'm also not a brand loyalist (owned Nokia, Palm, HTC and Motorola), and looked at every hand set individually. For me, a phone is a tool and it's all about functionality. I also don't need to have the latest and greatest every year either, which is why I want a removable battery, so I can replace it when I goes bad. I've had my S5 for a week now and even though it's my first ""flagship"" device, it's familiar yet new in all the right ways. I'm comfortable with it yet having a good time learning new things that my older phones couldn't do. I'm happy with my choice and don't need to second guess it because I did my homework. On a side note, I found some of the review sites difficult and frustrating to read and listen to. Problem being, they've all used and or owned everything out there for years now and they're not impressed by anything unless it's totally new and original. They're also obsessed with outer appearance and want everything to have a metal casing. In short, they're spoiled. A lot of them weren't as impressed with the S5 because they've had every Samsung Galaxy up to this point and wanted it to look and feel completely new. Well, I haven't, so it's new to me. As for the outer appearance, most of us are going to buy a case for our new phones so it's going to end up looking like that anyway. I was just a little put off by their, ""we want something new"" attitudes. Update: It's been 2 weeks now and I'm very impressed with the GS5. The battery life is outstanding! I can easily go 2 days off of one charge and that's something I've never been able to say before. The screen is fantastic for reading, the brightness and colors are off the charts. Everything pops on screen. Videos play smoothly and look good and the camera has tons of options and takes better pictures than any stand alone camera I've ever had. It's also very light weight and I can barely feel it in my pocket. There's still alot for me to learn though because this phone just has so many options. If you're interested, just get it, you won't be disappointed.","P. G. Keller ""Packerfan75""",Samsung_S5,417

I had resisted that move for several years, thinking that my Verizon phone bill would increase by another $40-50 over the $105 which I was already paying for their base plan. Stopping by Verizon to troubleshoot a minor malfunction of my LG dumb phone, I asked how much an upgrade phone would cost me and was shocked to find out that my total phone bill would drop to $60 per month by switching to a smart phone. Wow. No brainer and took the plunge. I am very impressed with this phone. The camera is simply amazing. I took some night shots at an outdoor concert and the image was as if it were still daylight outside. Also took shots of family around a campfire and they came out just as the eye would see them. Not grainy and good detail. My biggest complaint about the camera is the inability to capture images of children moving. They blur. I wish there was a manual ""high shutter speed"" option to override the auto function. If there is, I have not been able to find it by exploring all of the settings and options. The other negative to the camera that you need to be aware of... is the delay or lag time, from the time you press the ""shoot"" button, until the image is actually captured. You will miss some precious moments such as the look on a child's face sometimes. I understand though that you can shoot video and then screen capture a specific moment in the video, to accomplish precise photo saves. Haven't learned houw to do that yet. My digital daughters are going to show me. Other than that, the quality of the photos are better than all of the point and shoot cameras that I have owned over the years, although I never took the plunge for a Nikon or Canon digital SLR. The colors are precise, bright and overall fantastic. I had no idea what I was missing by not having a great camera on my person at all times, in the form of this phone. There are so many features on this phone and options to customize and control what the phone does, that the learning curve is fairly extensive and you will want to sit down and literally click through every level and every pop-up menu to see what can be done with programs, features, and settings. The phone does not come with a manual (only a quick start guide which doesn't tell you much) so be sure you download the extensive PDF manual from Samsung's website and store it on your PC, or laptop. I haven't tried storing it on my phone yet, but might be a good idea for when away from home. There is a fingerprint scanner which can unlock the phone. I tried it at first but found it to be extremely erratic. After it registered my thumb print and index fingerprint, it worked a couple of attempts, but I went back to the phone an hour later and it continually gave me an error message to try again. So I disabled that feature and find it easier to simply swipe the pattern on the 9 dot field. As you obviously know, by reading the product page features, is that this phone is water resistant and you can actually drop it into water (submersed), as long as it is not very deep (in which water pressure starts to have an impact, such as going 4-6 feet deep into a swimming pool). Great piece of mind for potential of dropping into the sink, running through the washing machine by accident, etc. It is officially rated to 1 to 2 feet deep, so I considered buying the LifeProof case which has better water depth protection, but there were an abundance of negative reviews for that case for this phone....which causes severe echo on phone conversations. I did buy the Otterbox Defender which is absolutely fantastic for this phone, for additional shock drop protection, cosmetic protection, and a screen protection which so far has been as scratch resistant as the best selling screen protector, ""Invisible Shield"", by Zagg (which seems to be the default choice for most purchasers). Subsequently, I discovered that Otter","Born in Kansas ""MK""",Samsung_S5,419

Unlike many other smartphones, it is water-resistant and contains its own Integrated Mobile Health Partner (S Health). S Health has proven to contain very accurate nutrition information on a vast amount of foods. It also possesses a heart rate detector and a pedometer, both of which can be very useful to any health-conscious individual. The phone has a very large and beautiful display but still weighs a mere 5.12 ounces. The camera on this smartphone is impeccable. I also like that you can transfer your entire iTunes library to the phone using Google Play. There is no need to download a new media player and purchase everything again. Other reviews state that the plastic on the back of the phone is a drawback but I disagree. Glass phones break very easily but I have dropped this phone multiple times without any surface damage being done. It is a considerably sturdy phone. Lastly, the S5's battery life is nothing to overlook. The advertisements state that the battery will last through 29 hours of talk time. I have personally experienced an instance showing how great the phone keeps its charge when I took it on a four hour car trip and streamed music online the entire time without losing more than 20% of the battery. After the battery dies completely, it only takes an hour and a half to charge back to 100%. Even though I highly recommend this phone to everyone, there is one very minor drawback. When setting up the phone you must create a Gmail account. This isn't an operational flaw but more of an inconvenience to the user. You now have to memorize another email address and password. Overall, this phone is worth the price tag. I plan on keeping it for a very long while.",Kimberly Davidson,Samsung_S5,431

But it's better with a few accessories. At first, I wondered about the design choice of having a ridge protruding at the edges of the phone above the touchscreen surface. The home button also sticks up a little. But after I put a tempered-glass screen protector on it, it made a lot more sense. Everything becomes flush. I think it was designed to be used with a screen protector. They probably realized most people were going to put one on anyway. This phone has a removable battery - and a removable back to go along with that. You can replace the original cover with a special Qi charging cover Samsung makes for it to enable wireless charging. That eliminates the need to mess with the USB port cover. Add in a couple wireless charging mats - the larger white ones Samsung made for the S4 are generally reviewed as the better ones - and anytime you want to top off your phone you can just set it on a mat. Note that if you want to use a case with the wireless charging cover, it has to be a special case designed for that - the wireless charging cover is slightly thicker than the default cover. Speaking of cases, I actually like the hand-feel of this phone better with a case. Tudia makes a nice TPU case that's compatible with the wireless charging cover, and you don't have to take the case off to charge. A case makes the phone thicker, but that thickness actually makes a phone of this size easier to hold for one-handed use - and helps to keep the bottom of your thumb from activating the back button inadvertently.",Tim Welch,Samsung_S5,432

I had to carefully consider the new iPhone since we have three iphones, two ipads, a macbook, and apple TV. I did my homework and realized that the iPhone 6 didn't offer anything the Galaxy s5 hadn't already been delivering for months. I was also ready for a bigger screen upgrade than a 4.7, but not ready for a phablet. Amazons deal on the phone was the final nail in the coffin. I've been able to get the phone, case, belt clip, screen protector, three car chargers, spare home charger, and 6' USB cable all for $185. For another $40 i can add 64g of memory on a high speed card. In order to match the package with a new iPhone I'd spend $300, plus another $100 or so on a Lifeproof Case and clip whenever they're available to keep it water resistant. For 64g total, I'd have to add another $100. And I'd still have a screen almost a half inch smaller with no ability to change batteries or memory cards. After only three days of use I'm already feeling comfortable with this phone. I needed to use my old iPhone today to turn off imessages, and I thought I was going to have to borrow my dad's reading glasses. If you're thinking about making the switch- do it.

I upgraded from my Razr Max and am very happy so far. I've had it for over a week. One of the first things I did (and you should too) is disabled the bloatware. There's a lot of it. I also got rid of the ugly default everything. It feels fast. I like the dust flap, for now. The camera is great. Don't be a fool (like I was at first) and make sure you scroll though all the option in the camera mode! The camera took me a few days to learn. The display is sharp. Power save and extra touch sensitivity could be useful. What I don't like: The heart rate monitor. Like many other reviews, it's kinda pointless and probably adds $100 to the phone. I don't like how clunky it is to access the camera from the unlock screen. The speakers are kinda dull, why can't they be on the front? If you are a Mac user like me, you need to install ""Android Safe Transfer"" which is total BS. You can't preview your files like you can in the Mac UI.

Thankfully I have a 64GB SD card so all my music, pictures, and videos go on that since they take up the most space. I'll probably remove the bloatware once I work up the courage and knowledge to root the phone.

Also I'm not thrilled with the buttons being on each side of the phone as often I end up clicking the down volume at the same time as the screen unlock button.

The Samsung Galaxy S5 is awe-inspiring. So let's get into it. First, the screen. While I am getting a little annoyed by how large cell phones are getting, I see the need for it. The picture quality is superb! But seen on a smaller screen, the quality would not shine through. I've always hated viewing videos on my cell phone, but the S5 does a great job of making me miss my laptop less. And games are more enjoyable too! Photos are so clear it's mindboggling. No cons here. Discussing the processor and other ""brain"" components is boring, so suffice it to say that the S5 is very fast and multitasks very well, without being a drain on the battery. Which brings me to... The battery! I've never seen such an impressive battery life. I don't know if they're using a special sort of battery or they've just figured out a way to use power more efficiently (which, without getting into it, they have figured out a way), but I don't care. All I care about is that my phone lasts all day and I'm a fairly heavy user. I must admit though, I'm not a heavy caller and making calls does use a lot of juice. I do use a lot of data however (both WiFi and 4G), and thus far have never run out of power. The camera is phenomenal, albeit cumbersome. There are just too many options for the casual user. If you're a professional photographer or even just a hobbyist, you've got a dedicated device. So if you're taking photos on your phone, you're probably just a regular person trying to capture a moment. In which case, you don't need 7,000 options that you don't know how to use. It's overkill and it's confusing. But, it does take great photos! I won't discuss data. We all have different carriers, so we'll all have different experiences. I use AT&T and for the most part have had no problems, except in underdeveloped parts of town. I will say, however, that the phone switches automatically between your 4G and your WiFi to help use less of your data plan. While that's very cost-efficient, I sometimes find that I'll be in the middle of something and my phone will get hung up waiting on the switch. That being said, there is an option to turn off the automatic switching. So, your choice. Most of you will already know that Samsung uses the Android operating system. Google is to credit or blame for most of what's going on there, and I, for one, like what they're doing, especially when compared to Apple, Microsoft, or even Blackberry. However, each phone maker tweaks Android to fit their vision. Before the S5, I had the HTC One. Let me just say that I am far happier with the S5 in almost every way. (I used to be a big Blackberry fan, but sadly, they're not keeping up.) Another point I won't get too much into is features. As I mentioned earlier, this phone is so feature rich, it's truly incredible. It does everything you're gonna want and it does it well, and it usually far exceeds expectations and the competition. I do have two things I'm not so in love with though. The first is the call quality. As I said, it's no worse than any other phone, but it still needs attention. For instance, with all the technological advances they've made, why do we still have half-duplex instead of full-duplex? (More info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speakerphone) The phone call experience is the one time when I feel like I'm back in the 1980s. My second problem with this phone is the sound output. First, it's just not loud enough. I'm not talking about the little speaker on the back. I'm not expecting much from that. I'm referring to the ""line out"" and bluetooth. I like to use Audible to listen to books while I'm travelling to and from work or when I'm at the gym. When I play Pandora or the songs I ha",SaaaM,Samsung_S5,452

I've never had any problems with it. It's super fast and responsive. The screen resolution is excellent and it takes better pictures than my FIL's $1,900 Sony camera. I do have one gripe about what I consider to be an internal design flaw. In the event of a relatively low drop from about 3 ft directly on it's front my friend had the S5 screen go blank. It wouldn't respond to touch and was completely blank. He asked me to look at it since it already had a small crack in in the corner of the screen and he couldn't get it warrantied. You cannot access the display connectors on these phones from the back. You have to remove the screen. Using a hotplate, I warmed the display and gently separated the screen from the body. I found that the display connector had come unplugged from the drop. I plugged it back in and the display was working again. Why in the world would Samsung make a phone where the connector is inaccessible like this and where there's enough space for it to pop free!!! A simple piece of foam on the connector or the back of the screen would completely solve this issue. A quick search shows several others having this same issue. Some were able to get warranty coverage while others had to pay almost $200 to get them fixed. It's really a simple repair that took 10 minutes.

I got it a month ago and have been playing with it ever since--and to my great surprise, those pre-installed apps I thought were just bells-and-whistles fluff turned out to be very useful--like the S Health App which measures your heart rate and tracks your steps! (I got 10,000 steps in one day and felt very proud when the icon turned gold and it played a tune and congratulated me!!) I've now had 4 Samsung phones, and this one is the best by far. Everything about it is well-thought-out and well done. I love the screen size, love the simplicity of using it, love the battery strength (it's never run down completely yet, and I use it A LOT during the day). The camera is amazing--and I'm not a visual person, so when I see shots I took with the camera and I'M impressed, that says something! The detail in these photos is spectacular; I've never seen anything like it. I'm also much relieved that the phone is water-resistant, because my last Samsung was water-damaged and never behaved quite the same way afterward. I wholeheartedly recommend this phone; I expect to be enjoying it for as long as my Verizon contract lasts.","Susan Sloate, Author, FORWARD TO CAMELOT & STEALING FIRE",Samsung_S5,463

My lady was the S3..now an S5. I frankly looked the heft of the S3 better. I know some think lighter is better but I do not think that is true. For this reason I bought a Zenus case that matches my galaxy note 2014 edition case. For me I have found that in cases you get what you pay for and Zenus is my favorite. Unfortunately they are only made for certain models. The phone handles beautifully except for setting up Microsoft exchange. It told me that I had 10 device limit already. However I am not sure if that may be a server issue holding on to devices not used any longer and I never had 10. All in all I agree with those that say do not pay attention to plastic body. I always use a case. To me it is how the phone functions and this one is great. I really am an android fan and the new galaxy is just what I am liking for. My one and only complaint is the door where the power charger hooks up. It feels flimsy and I always feel as if it is going to break off. It is hard to open without a spare pin or something to get into the place where you open it. Other than that ..no complaints.,Amazon Customer,Samsung_S5,464

My biggest complaints: 1) I use Bluetooth a lot (Big Jambox and headphones) and the S5 skips consistently with both devices. My old phone never did that. Called verizon tech support but they couldn't do anything. 2) battery life is okay, but not great. Granted I use my phone a lot, but I expect a phone this big to have a battery that will get me through the day and this often does not. Why can't Power Saving Mode or Ultra Power Saving Mode be enabled when the battery reaches a certain %? It has to be manually enabled? Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose? 3) the volume is low. Can barely hear folks on speaker in my car. Wish the speakers were on the front like the HTC One 4) feels too fragile and awkward for one-hand operation (even with one handed mode enabled) the good: Fast ""waterproof"" great screen great camera easy to use UI May give the HTC One M8 a try or the Droid Maxx",Robert Shaye,Samsung_S5,468

Ordered the phone on a Friday, delivered the next Tuesday! Amazon emailed me the instructions for activation with Verizon, which worked flawlessly. This phone is phenomenal.

The camera lens is as fragile as a newborn baby. My phone slipped from the sofa to the floor, which was approximately 1.5' distance. And the lens shattered into a zillion pieces. Yes, it is glass. Yes, glass breaks. But why on earth put an extremely fragile piece of thin glass in such a vulnerable location? It's absurd.

The Samsung Galaxy S5 has met all of my expectations. The biggest issue for me with cell phones is battery life and charge time. Does the battery last a reasonably long time and how fast does it charge up? The Galaxy S5 battery has a long life. I haven't needed to charge it daily and it does charge fast. I have yet to have the battery level drop below 50% in a day's moderate use and it charged fully in less than an hour. Another positive for this phone is that the battery can be replaced. If you get a weak battery you can buy a cheap replacement and change it yourself. I find the power saver settings to be beneficial to battery life on this phone. Included in the box were the user's manual and a really nice home charger. This has a double port charger which is something I haven't seen before. The charger was impressive, looks and feels like a durable, high qulaity charger. The Galaxy S5 is one of the easier to navigate phones that I have owned. The manual is helpful, but the layout of this phone makes it easier to get adjusted to without consulting the manual. Browsing the web is another stongpoint on this model. The speed and ease of use is top-notch! Browsing is so easy! Another feature that I really appreciate is the controls below the bottom of the screen. The right side is a back button, the left side brings up a task manager where I can close apps(Chrome browser, email etc..). I have had phones in the past where I had to hunt for the close apps function. Not so with the Galaxy S5. The weather app has been a convenience. For call clarity and signal strength, this phone has been excellent! Everything about this phone has been positive in my experience. I'd buy it again and my Verizon service experience has been dependable as well.",J.L. Populist,Samsung_S5,490

I'm getting all my apps squared away and customizing for my personal taste is smooth enough. It doesn't take long to recognize that the phone has some really nice features - I'm not yet able to report on battery life but that's why I upgraded. I had the original Droid Razr that I had to pre-order because it wasn't yet known just how pathetic that battery performance actually was. Thanks, Motorola. I am curious as to why the phone costs $250 with a 2-year contract in the Verizon Store and $100 on Amazon. There is a $50 mail-in rebate but it's still twice as much. And there's the $30 activation fee and the old 'by-the-way', that unlimited data plan you were grandfathered into no longer applies. I now get 2 GB and additional fees apply if that is exceeded. But, they assured me that after the initial bill with the activation fee, my Family Plan bill would remain the same. I'll update that if that turns out to be false. I did buy their $20 roll-on screen protector but their process is nothing special. I could have just used the run-of-the-mill protector. I tried the 16 MP camera in daylight and it was very crisp. Big chunk of data if you upload using other than WiFi but the one thing that is consistent about Verizon is you're lucky to get an edge signal here. Downloads that size would crash and burn using cell service. Yea, it bright red 4G LTE on the map but not on the phone. Unfortunately, nobody has ever commented on how good their carrier's signal is here. Scary since there are a lot of boaters on the bay who think the phone is a good alternative to VHF radio. On the other hand, a surprise came when I noticed how far I was from the house and still connected to my home network. Simply amazing. The one glitch I see is that the weather reported by the phone is incorrect. The location and time are correct but that's a glitch I have yet to figure out. It'll consistently refresh with the wrong information. Maybe it's just telling me what I want to hear. I've set the fingerprint reader to unlock the phone and it works but sometimes takes a few tries. There is the option of using patterns and passwords instead. No bells and whistles omitted on this phone. I could live without the cover that protects the USB and HDMI connectors and expect that will be the one thing that breaks. Just a hunch. There is a slot for an additional SD card and the one from my old Droid now lives there. Plenty of memory. Also, the battery is replaceable and that's a big deal to me. Needs no special tools like the aftermarket kits to open the Motorola and Apple devices. Speaking of which, someone was returning the new Apple phone while I was buying the Samsung. Don't know why but not a good sign. A lot of words for a phone I've had for just a day but it's a lot of phone.","Dennis ""DTz""",Samsung_S5,491

I use my phone (Galaxy S5) quite a bit for personal use and iPhone 5 for work I have the following and/or used the following before: 1) iPhone 5 2) Galaxy S5 3) Galaxy S3 4) Wife’s Moto X 5) Galaxy Nexus 6) Nexus One 7) iPhone 3GS 8) Amazon Fire Phone I’ve been through many devices and also Kindle Fire Tablets. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year. I will provide a detail comparison between the smartphones I use and a little bit of Kindle Fire comparison (which uses similar OS) Spec (8/10): This is a total spec phone. At the time of release it is the fastest phone available but by a small margin. However in android, every Ghz counts and Galaxy S5 is the best for it Screen (9/10): This screen is very nice. At 1080p, it may not have the clarity of the Galaxy S5 but beats the iPhone 5. Video on this is crisp. Running 720p content is absolutely fabulous on this device and no shadowing whatsoever. Sound(8/10): The sound system in this phone is 24bit/192khz. All the lossless music you can heard very properly through this: Build & Styling (7/10): It does not feel as strong as the Moto X or the Galaxy Nexus because of its thinness. It’s great for looks but bad for drops. I suggest getting an cover for it. I myself got a Zeroshock rugged case to protect this from drops because it doesn’t looks very structurally supported with its thiness Camera (8/10) Galaxy S5 16MP ISOCELL camera but it serves it purpose. There is no Optical Image Stabilization on this camera which is Is bad for motion. Blurry shots are frequent and I won’t recommend high speed photos with this. The best part about the camera is not actually the camera but the free cloud storage on the camera. You get UNLIMITED photo storage using the Fire Phone. For the ones that go crazy snapping around all the time, you don’t have to worry about storage space anymore. Remember this is for photos and not for videos. Videos still have storage limits. Software & Experience (8/10): This Touchwiz is very bloated. There’s even more bloatware than on S3 and it can slow your device to a halt sometimes. The Google Play Edition can be good choice with stock android experience and native speed Battery (6.5/10): it has removable battery pack which is excellent for replacing your battery on the fly or the fat extended battery. I am using a 8500mAh battery for this Complimentary Accessories (6/10): Headphone / charger/ usb 3.0 cable for fast data transmission in one package. You have all you need to start. However, it is not very well built especially the earphone which i suggest getting replacement. Value (6/10): For Galaxy S4 user, this is not much good for you. Very marginal upgrade for top tier price. Seems like for smartphone we are peaking in terms of return on performance through each generation. Now it's about getting the experience right which some argued saying Moto X or iPhone got this right without the massive spec behind the device","Amazon Reviewer ""Reviewing is my greatest interest""",Samsung_S5,492

There isn't many amazing things to this phone over the Galaxy S3 but like I said it will be more up to speed than your old phone. The heartbeat and other Health stuff is a nice little tracking thing...gets you thinking about your health a little more. I love the battery door for this phone. Seems a tiny bit cheezy looking in texture and material yet it really does give you a decent amount of grip. My S3 I had purchased one of the Pleather battery doors to add grip because I am all about slim phones and not bulky cases...and with this one this battery door offers the same grip for the most part and I like that...try gettign away without a case on the HTC One M8 once...bet that phone goes flying quite a few times! If you came from one of the many poor Android Phones to a Galaxy S3 and were blown away you may want to be prepared to be a little less blown away this time...but this is still probably one of the top 2...maybe three Android phones on the market. It is one of only two on the market right now I would recommend to most people. (HTC One M8, This and maybe LG G3)",G. Stewart II,Samsung_S5,494

It's light and easy to carry, not as big as I thought it would be. I'm not a phone geek. I mostly use my phone as a phone with an occasional text and to keep tabs on emails I get throughout the day. The S5 was very intuitive to get started with and to use. I had no problems importing my contacts or updating/cleaning out out of date items. Everyone seems to rave about the camera so I had higher expectations. It's fine, but certainly not as good as a real camera. I'm OK with it and it's easy to use as well. Call quality is good and notifications definitely keep you updated on your messages, calls, update status, etc. It's easy to either remove or disable a lot of the apps on the phone that I'll never use...like games and sports apps. I have no use for those and they were easy to remove. Others can easily be disabled. So, after only a few days I rate this phone very high. It's the best phone I've ever used...not that that's a ringing endorsement...I used a flip-phone up until a few years ago. I'd say anyone would be hard-pressed to find something negative about this unless you're really, really picky.",Carl S,Samsung_S5,495

Samsung did things right, not perfectly in all ways, but this phone is light years ahead of Apple. For starters, switching over to Android is made dirt simple and quick by using SmartSwitch. All of my music, contacts, notes, etc., was copied over to my S5 quick and easy. Yes, there is some issues with Android Kitkat not permitting third party apps not being able to write to the SD expansion card, but the Samsung ""My Files"" app makes it easy to get around that limitation without rooting the phone. Many apps can still be stored on the SD card saving device memory. The choices you get and the versatility you get with the Android makes this phone a much better option than buying an iPhone. I recently purchased a usb slave cable which makes let's the S5 use an external keyboard, hard drive, or flash drive with ease and I love the added capacity for file handling. At $100 for a contract phone, why shell out big $$ for a lesser phone with a degraded experience. The coolest smartphone is not the iPhone.",Roger Carroll,Samsung_S5,496

This phone does not work with integrated Bluetooth in my car. It does not reconnect and when I do connect and make calls people I am talking to cannot hear. I have to disconnect and talk directly with the phone. All of this worked great on my S3 phone. When I use a headset plugged in the people I am talking to all complain about an echo. When I try to use the speaker phone the people I talk to cannot hear. In short the only way this phone makes a descent phone call is a standard call stuck to the side of your head. Another problem I have is when I play music. It makes a pop noise at the start of every song.

I am Apple Fan boy? obliviously not if I purchased the Samsung. Honestly though I wanted to purchase an Iphone but more importantly I wanted to purcahse the best phone out there. I am afraid that at that time (april 2014 and even now this is the best phone available. I have an Ipad, and Ipod and and MacBook, so I am semi invested into the Apple platform, but what put me over the edge was 4 features. 1. Larger Screen, 2. removable battery, 3. Micro SD card slot (allowing me to add up to 64 Megabytes. ) 4. Value for a top tier smart phone(I paid $99 3 weeks after this phone was released) Truth is that apple isn't going ever have number 2 or 3 or 4. Likely this fall the Number 1(larger screen) will be filled, and one can purchase a higher capacity Iphone but I purchased a 32 gigabyte SD card for $16 and well the Iphone is already more money and upping the Gig's is just expensive. This combined with the fact that IMHO there was no killer feature on the Iphone 5S. I think the fingerprint scanner has the potential to be the killer feature but until Apple opens up the API to 3rd parties. Even then I think Apple needs to somehow forge a partnership with a major bank to make so I can leave my wallet at home. This would be a killer feature.

The HTC audio wins hands down as does its basic appearance, but the Samsung phones are also great. This black phone is more of a dark gray than true black and the entire case is plastic, giving it a cheaper appearance. I love the Electric Blue color, but since all phones are protected by case covers, the rears are not visible anyway. Unlike the HTC, this one offers a removable battery, which along with its superior camera, are why we purchased a pair of these on Verizon Wireless. The phone arrives loaded with apps which are unnecessary and not wanted, so what we could easily remove, we did. The Health app is used daily by my daughter, I'm not as diligent myself. A weakness of this phone, particularly as compared to the HTC, is the rear speaker which muffles the audio while the phone is resting. I've found that by keeping it face down, it's easier to hear. The fingerprint security option hasn't worked well for either of us, so it's not currently being used. Samsung uses its own power port, think of a conjoined USB with a smaller twin port, the same as the Samsung tablet.

I'd consider the HTC One m8, iPhone 6 series and the Motorola X (2014) are the same generation. It is hard to compare the UI features, as I think it is more personal preference than performance base. However, I do have to note that the home screens are a little over crowed, and features don't have details adjustment/customizing. For example, the ""clock/weather"" widget can't adjust to different size .. I think this a minor issue, not so ""refine"" ... I do not prefer that when I flip to the left, Samsung force the ""My magazine"" or flipboard there. That's take up valuable space!! I don't need that for the whole page . Now I can flip to the left and use that space to organize my apps .. Yes... I do agree that the phone has good screen hardware and above average camera. However, I cannot see how it can justify its build quality comparing to others, especially at over $650 MSRP . And that's the main reason I rated 3 stars. One of my biggest dislikes is the plastic / chrome quality. I use to phone only 3 days, never drop, and usually put in a big semi-empty messenger bag before I can a phone case. Then, I only put in my pocket with some coins, and walk less than 30 min, and the sliver chrome on the edge already come off!! WTH? I expect better than this at $650. Then, the back cover, it really as thin as potato chip, And it doesn't come with charging back cover?! Even the Palm Pre Plus come with it back in 2008. and the back cover was a little thicker too. Overall, I still like the phone, but when comparing to others, it is just average... the overwhelming PLUS that I won't deny are that it has replaceable battery, easy to access expandable memory. If other starts to offer that, Samsung may not be my choose. I still have to wait and see how ""durable"" and ""reliable"" the phone is. It means its general manufacturing quality. HTC phones do have good and impressive hardware and software combination. However, its battery and ""durability"" ( how long it last) is a question. I have other HTC phones, it start dying after 18 mo. Motorola phones that I had were like rock. They don't look or perform impressive.

Pros: Relatively responsive, good hardware, good battery Cons: Too much bloatware, overrated camera, connecting charger is weirdly difficult, 16GB goes fast (especially with the bloatware, unless you root your phone and remove...and yeah, I know you can add SD cards, but still), a lot of the gimmicky features don't work well Summary: So Samsung, for better or worse, has sort of a declining reputation despite selling a whole lot of phones. I think a lot of it has to do with their odd relationship with Google, and more specifically the Android operating system. It is no secret that they are trying to move away from Android, which is quite clear (sometimes painfully) with the Galaxy S5. Sure, it is Android. But along with that comes a lot of Samsung bloatware apps that the vast majority of people would rather not have on their phones. And unfortunately these apps take up a lot of precious space on this 16GB phone. This phone is fairly snappy in terms of performance, although I haven't tried other contemporary flagship phones (e.g. HTC One, Moto X+1, iPhone 6). What kind of surprised me is the poor camera quality, especially since reviewers seemed to sing its praises online. Let's just say that the iPhone 6 takes far superior pictures (and I hate to admit this, as a loyal Android customer).

When I first bought it I had my concerns about the sturdiness of the charging cover. It is held on by a tiny plastic piece which is bound to wear down and break off with daily opening and closing to charge. Well, it did break off in 2 months. This was with me being very careful because I didn't trust the cover. It is not covered under ATT warranty. I can mail my phone to Samsung for a couple weeks while they look at it and decide it'll it was my fault or not. Maybe, I would get lucky and they would fix the cover. But what's the point? To do it all over again in 2 months. I don't think so. I just want to buy a case for it that will cover the exposed charging ports (like the ones Otter makes for the Note) but I can't find one so I guess they don't make them. Ugh Also, I upgraded from the s2 when I got this phone and I expected a huge improvement in speed. But I continue to have lag with apps, freezing screens, and slow response time. And it never ants to recognize my fingerprint. But that is probably user error. The camera is pretty nice. The sound quality is okay. It is just an okay phone, though.",DawgRD,Samsung_S5,541

I decided to use it for a while before I wrote my review. I upgraded from an iPhone 4S. You can look at all the positive reviews on this site if you are looking for that info. I would like to focus on the things that irritate me the most, to the point that I regret buying this phone. If anyone knows any fixes for these issues please leave in the comments. If anyone else has experienced these issues, please comment and check as helpful review thanks! . Annoying things about S5 It constantly loses default settings. Freezes and won't restart. When the phone rings touch is unresponsive and I can't answer. Sometimes when I'm on a call touch is unresponsive and I can't use the keypad. When I set certain apps to not send push notifications, once I restart the phone, its all forgotten. The chrome around the bezel is already coming off. The brightness in a dark setting is still too bright even on auto adjust. I have to manually do it. The piece that covers the charging port no longer seals correctly. Now the phone is no longer waterproof. Unless you are wall charging the phone, it'll charge at a slow 1% per 10 minutes. Constantly drops wifi signal. Constantly says security update failed regardless of how many times I try to update it. When switching to video mode it automatically starts recording video. Every time I plug headphones in and raise the volume it warns me how loud music can damage my hearing. I have to click ok to continue or I can't raise the volume. Other issues that may have slipped my mind, but the default settings issue is the most irritating.",A. Mariscal,Samsung_S5,559

I had the S3 for several years and was very happy with it. 1) The day after I received my phone, I stopped receiving text messages completely. I worked with the T-mobile rep to rectify it. I had to do a hard reset on the phone. Although I never received my missed texts, it seemed to work after that. I was told that the phones were shipped with faulty software that Samsung was aware of. Texts have worked fine since them. 2) The speakerphone is a half-duplex instead of full duplex. That means that when the other person was talking or making noise on their end, they could never hear me. I was never sure if they were hearing what i was saying or if it was actually going through. For example, if I was talking to someone on speakerphone who was in their car and had a lot of noise on their end, they would never hear me. As someone who uses speakerphone a lot, this is a major problem. My Samsung S3 was full duplex. I never had this problem. 3) My email never properly synced with my server. If i looked at emails on my computer, they would still show as unread on my phone even AFTER I hit the sync button. I would delete emails on my phone and after I synced, they would re-appear. 4) I would choose a specific ringtone for different friends and it would only work SOMETIMES. One time I might get the ringtone that I specified and another time I might get my generic ringtone. No rhyme or reason. 5) Because I live in NYC, some subway stations have cell service and others do not. If I sent a text when I didn't have service, it SHOULD simply send when I got above ground or to a station that had service. It wouldn't. The text would just sit there and never send. I would have to copy/paste it to a NEW text and send again. 6) I used the map service to find a friend who was several blocks away. I had an address and when I put it into the phone, it sent me in the complete wrong direction. In fact, the map started spinning as if it had no idea how to locate where I was or where I was going. 7) There was a serious lag because of Touchwiz. It's almost as if the phone is thinking about what it needs to do. I'm being shipped a new phone but I'm not sure if it will fix ANY of these problems. If it doesn't, I'm going to have to choose a new one. Samsung REALLY rushed this one out.",Craig,Samsung_S5,573

In the first few days, it took three Verizon Wireless Customer Service Reps to set up the email functions. Ironically, the primary email was a Verizon email address. None of the Reps considered the set up to be a ""hardware"" issue. I discussed replacing this Samsung with a new unit, but they asked me to try more solutions. Then on the 16th day, two days after the 14-day return policy expired, the phone failed so completely that it could not make calls or text messages. Finally on the 17th day after the purchase, Verizon acknowledged that it was a hardware problem and agreed to replace it with a refurbished unit. I asked for a different model or a brand new unit, the Verizon Rep denied the request because the ""return"" was made a couple days after the 14-day return policy based on the arrangement with Samsung, and they had too much inventory on Samsung S5 to offer another brand. The Rep did not consider the first three technical calls to be ""hardware"" related, even though email had been working perfectly fine on the old Motorola phone just an hour before switching to Samsung. Everyone of the Reps blamed the issues with the third party app developer not working properly with Android devices. They alluded that Facebook, Yelp, and many other popular apps would ""interfere"" with the performance of the phone. The phone was bad to start with, Verizon service made the experience even worse. Please explore other options when consider buying this phone. I will switch to another wireless carrier the first opportunity.",Fever Mom,Samsung_S5,582

I had previously been using an iPhone 5S Gold from Verizon. After many, many, many billing discrepancies I asked what could be done to rectify the problem. They told me that getting a new sim card would help, tried that and it didn't work. I was frustrated. I then saw somebody was selling a like new S5 for a good deal and I offered my iPhone as a trade. They took it and the rest was history. Now I have my new phone and am enjoying it. After my previous issues with the S4, I'm pleased to say Samsung actually has it right this time. They focused on what people critiqued them about, and made this phone IMMENSELY better than anything out there. I've had many cell phones in the past, and mostly have had DROIDS, but have always also had a soft-spot for iPhones, there are a couple of apps that I cannot get on the play store, I could with my iPhone on the App Store. These weren't essential, but were fun word games like Bookworm. I also don't like what apps you can get like Angry Birds, on the S5 they have advertisements thru the whole game. I'm told it's just with Android, and same with the permissions, I understand that different games need to know if a call is in progress in order to start working, but it doesn't need to analyze your call log. It seems as though apps are a bit more intrusive. I don't game all that much, and when I do, it's from my console, so this ""con"" if you can even call it that doesn't even bother me. I'm just confused because it kinda gives people the edge that their information might not be safe. S4 did this when I installed a different keyboard. But I can't complain. The S-Health app is far more accurate than the health app offered by Apple. The reason being is that this one on the Android lets you input things such as the foods you eat, etc, and is set up to tell you that you burned off a certain amount of those calories. This phone can also take your heart beat per minute and gauge your health and exercise off of that plan. It helps many people stay fit. The camera is by far the best I've had on any phone out there. No cons when it comes to the camera, but it could be better at times at focusing on a moving object. I've heard that the Note 4 is good for still shot focusing, but if it takes pictures with a tiny bit of delay like mine, it's not going to turn out well. Sound quality is awesome. Music and speakerphone are great. Smart Remote is freaking amazing. I've never had a phone that could double as my phone remote, my stereo remote, tell me different channels as a TV guide and also work remotely with my DVR to record shows. iOS has some catching up to do on that part, the only way I can see it working with them is if there is an ""APP FOR THAT"" BTW, if you are looking for a good case and not wanting to spend big bucks, check out the Spigen Neo Hybrid. I have had this case on my phone since the first day I rec'd it and I cannot be happier with this case. 4G LTE/XLTE data, but you know how fast that is already. Surprisingly good support with my MBP. I've had many phones, but I really like this one. I know I say in previous reviews that I can see myself staying with a certain product or program for a certain amount of time, and then back out and go to something else, but this item I can say that I will stay with.",NARNTEK3049,Samsung_S5,602

Another world from s3. Powerful processor. Sharp camera image for photos I imported in on cloud and memory card but not highly impressed with first few photos I took with this camera the delay from pushing button and photo being taken is too long. Finger print security totally works for me....followed instructions and swipe full pad.S5 doesn'the have a great speaker phone. Some Samsung apps that were on S3 and Note2 are not here. Do not like chrome as much as Internet Explorer and can't install on phone. Can't read documents as well as on Note 2...Note 2 allows more enlarging than s5 . Note 2 doesn't have great phone clarity though. Note 2 is great mini tablet while S5 is a great phone. So everything isn't perfect but I really love how powerful this phone is from my dead s3.

S5- using the phone with everything the same as the droid razr maxx...1.5 hours tops before it's dead. So disappointed, cant let grand daughter play a game because it would be dead in seconds.

After riding the iPhone bandwagon for years, I thought it would be a great time to switch over to Android and give it a shot. Being that this was the best phone on the market, performance wise, at the time (mid summer 2014), I went in and bought this phone blindly. This was a huge mistake. This phone is full of bugs and problems. Let me list a few: 1. Bloatware everywhere 2. Unresponsive and laggy (app applications) 3. Camera takes 20 seconds to load 4. Bluetooth audio streaming skips 5. Messages wont send half the time. 6. Phone freezes often 7. Finger print sensor doesn't recognize my finger and has almost bricked my phone before 8. Screen looks burned in and colors fade from top to bottom. 9. Have to clear text messages every other day to speed phone up This phone has so many software problems I can't even begin to get into detail. Its a shame that this phone has such amazing hardware but the software it utilizes is garbage. I feel as if this phone can't allocate RAM properly. The point of having such a fast processor and 2 Gb of RAM is so that multitasking is smooth but this is not the case. If I receive a notification while I'm in an application, the application freezes for a few seconds. God forbid I receive a few notifications in a row... I went to the store recently and played with the latest LG phones and these literally blow the S5 out of the water. The only good thing about this phone is that it takes amazing pictures in daylight. My friends love this phone, so I'm not really sure why I've had such bad experiences with this phone. My charging port wont seal properly, so I'm going to get a replacement and see if it was just my phone in particular that was causing all of these issues. Please do not buy this phone unless you can deal with a huge amount of lag.",Jon K,Samsung_S5,671

Unfortunately you have to open the usb cover to charge the phone. The usb cover is a very cheap plastic cover attached via a very small plastic band. This plastic band wears out and the cover breaks off from the phone. Hence no waterproof phone. If you really want a waterproof phone, look elsewhere or at least read up on the issue of broken usb covers and decide if you want to deal with this hassle. Oh, Samsung will maybe replace your phone under warranty if this happens as long as you give them your phone for 2 weeks and they decide that the cheap plastic was defective and didn't break because you opened the cover too hard. So you can either ignore the waterproof claim, buy a wireless charging cover, or never charge your phone. Do any of those and you are golden. Do anything else and you are at the mercy of Samsung's customer service. Good luck with that.",JT,Samsung_S5,678

I don't know how Samsung released a phone that is basically not ready. Almost every app lags, especially compared to my old S3. Tap anything and the norm is a long pause before a reaction. Even on the camera, taking a picture requires several seconds before you can even see what your shot looked like. I read that Samsung is aware that ""limited number"" of S5 have camera issues. Great. The fingerprint sensor takes a while to read; I'm not sure if this is by design, but it is frustrating. Other than that, its a nice touch to have the added security. I really wanted to like this phone and like the way it looks. Oh well. Back to the S3 for now.",Dane Solon,Samsung_S5,683

No matter what I would have purchased, it would have been better than the POFS Rezound. The S5 obviously blows the POFS out of the water but there are still some issues. I have had numerous smart phones beginning with the Motorola Q and moving on to the Palm Treo 700W, Blackberry Touch, HTC Incredible, POFS and now the Samsung S5. First off, the camera takes really good pictures but is still really ""grainy"" when I zoom in. I have not tweaked any of the settings in the camera, even though I have had the S5 since April 11th(opening day). In the 22 days that I have had it, it has turned off 3 times on its own. Once, I was listening to music on the Amazon MP3 app and I answered a phone call but when I ended the call, the phone rebooted on it's own. It boots really fast so it's not much of an issue. Two other times, I was downloading apps, and opening/closing certain other apps and it just decided to reboot. These are not deal breakers. One of the things that is complete junk on this phone is the ""fingerprint scanner"" security option. Maybe it is because I have really big hands and fingers, but it would not work at all, period. It registered my fingerprint but it would never allow me to unlock the phone, using that same finger. I turned that option off and just went back to the typical ""pattern"" security option. POFS wouldn't even work when I tried to install Go Launcher Ex so I was looking forward to using it on the Samsung S5. Nope!! I downloaded Go Launcher Ex and was using it for a few days and everything seemed to be working well. I had it on my nightstand, one evening, and when I picked it up, I noticed it was extremely hot. There was a notice on the screen that said that it was overheating and was shutting down most everything on the phone but the bare minimum until it cooled off. Yes, I have a task killer installed and it is running constantly so I do not think that I had too many apps running. The phone was just sitting on the nightstand. I uninstalled Go Launcher Ex and I have not had that issue again. The Health app is pretty cool but I would trust it about as much as our current dictator. This phone uses USB 3.0 chargers but also will work with your older 2.0 chargers and chords. One of the greatest things about the S5 is the amount of time that a charge will last. POFS got about four hours before it died. Yep, four freaking hours!!! I regularly get about sixteen hours of use before the S5 dies and that is on days where I am using it on regular basis. Today, when I hardly used the S5, I unplugged it at 530AM and after almost 12 hours the phone still has 59% available. As a contractor, one of the big things that drew me to this phone was the fact that it was waterproof but the fact that it is ""dustproof"" is my favorite. There is a ""charger cover"" that seals the charging port and keeps the phone ""dust/waterproof"". I am not sure how durable this little piece will be but it seems to be holding up so far. All in all, this is a good phone and most everyone will be happy with it. I would rate it as 3.51 stars. There will always be room for improvement!",David N. Jorn,Samsung_S5,696

About 4 months after I bought it, the charger quit working. I called Samsung for a warranty replacement. I have registered the phone with Samsung, but the agent didn't have the information, so I had to end the call, remove the battery, and find the IMEI number in tiny script (magnifying glass). After putting me on hold for a couple minutes, she told me that I would have to send the charger to them with the receipt. They would evaluate it to be sure there was no damage, and then send me another. This would take up to 11 days. Happily, I have the charger from my previous phone. If I didn't, my phone would be useless for that time without a charger. Looks like Samsung's main concern is that I might be ripping them off.",Don Bishop,Samsung_S5,715

That being said this is a review of an Android. So how could I hate this product more than my Apple product? Easy. This is the dumbest smartphone I've had the stupidity to buy. You want an audio nanny! You got one! I don't ever wear headphones and use this primarily via the aux port in my car to stream radio. The phone WILL NOT remember your previous audio settings and unless you change a setting will give you an annoying warning every single time about listening to music too loud! You want a phone with more apps than you can shake a stick at? Done. Seriously, I've never in my life seen a phone so loaded with so much useless garbage. Why do I need two email clients just so I can check gmail and yahoo? WHYYYYY? Further to the point the required gmail client isn't even fully featured and wont display when you've got new mail. SOOOOO bad. You want a phone that fights you every step of the way and doesn't put anything in places that make sense? Here ya go. I've never had so much trouble trying to find simple settings such as trying to figure out how to adjust push pull options for something like Yahoo mail. I've never had to spend HOURS on google trying to figure out where something is located or how to do a task on a phone. This phone has induced more rage than trying to watch your favorite football team on Sunday on a satellite dish in heavy rain! The funny thing is, all of the Android owners around me were like you've finally switched! How is it? And when I tell them I hate it, and start to list all the reasons why, they are all like oh... yeah... your right about that. !!!! Seriously, I spent over 45 minutes detailing why this phone sucks to my brother in law and he didn't have a single counter, not one! Oh and for all that talk about this being a USB 3 device? LOL. You have to go into airplane mode to even use it and when you do it still isn't near as fast as even a traditional external drive. All that being said, there are two positive things about this phone, One: I don't have to use iTunes to sync files to my phone (flips off Apple). Two: it has an expandable storage which means I can add another 128gb to phone with a micro sd card for cheap compared to buying a phone with huge space and huge markups to boot.

After switched to those new Galaxy S5 phones, we often have to manually go to setup to scan already paired devices to get connection. That is not convenient for sitting into car then have to go to phone configuration. In addition, our older Samsung phone can alert us for the instant message, and read out them. This new Galaxy S5 can not do that with our C-MAX Bluetooth feature any more. That is not all the problem. We have a third party chat utility. that was working fine with older phone. Once we moved over to Samsung Galaxy S5, we have to either power off then power on, or restart the phone, to make that chat program send and receive. We have to do that couple times a day for every phone. Other brand phones do not have this problem. We contacted Samsung support reporting these problems. Their report replied to us: Our phone has no known software bug. Please contact your carried support for helping how to use this phone.

What a stupid design! My galaxy S5 has enough useless features to fill days of exploration yet the home button wakes the phone and there's no way to disable this feature.

From there to the misdeal phone numbers to the deletion of important info, the way is very short. I guess it's okay, it only cost $700... I contacted Samsung but they had no help to offer other that going around it by putting a number or pattern lock on the phone. Surly my pants pocket isn't that smart.

I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. I will not call Samsung Galaxy S5 as revolutionary, but it is certainly evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. I love Samsung Galaxy S5 from its competitors for few reasons - removable battery, microSD card support and the maturity of the product. I have been using a S5 for past couple of days and have ordered a unlocked one from my local store. There are so many variants already in the market. So do check local specs. For example, in china market dual SIM S5 is available. Galaxy S5's back plate has a perforated dot pattern and a excellent matte finish. As a result, the phone looks far more sophisticated than its past designs despite its plastic build. Its surface feels nice to the touch without being too rough or too slippery. I really do _not_ care about the plastic, in fact the lightweight nature is what I care. Some people make a huge deal out of it. A high quality plastic is good for lightweight and I go with lightweight than a heavy phone in the pocket. A reputed tech site called recently Samsung as the “undisputed king of the Android smartphone space”. True indeed. With the plethora of devices in tablets/phones, they have iterated so much that they can produce truly stunning products. If you care for weight, the Galaxy S4 is lighter than S5. (please see my stats below). In fact pixel density is slightly higher in S4 due to a 0.1in size difference. So get an S4, it is cheaper and still same phone that came out last year. If you care for heart rate monitor, fingerprint scanner, and water proof, get the S5. Otherwise literally similar set and you can save a lot by getting S4 now. Last year when S4 came out it was a great phone. It still is, though S5 came out now. Obsoletion is in the mind of the us, not on the devices. In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice.

This phone is rediculously fast as heck! Way faster than my old Galaxy S3 dual core version!. Everying seem to just fly away! #-battery- I can't gauge the battery life since it hasn't been long since I got this phone from the store but am sure it will last longer than my S3.# update 4-15-15# so its been a couple of days since I have S5 and I could give a good idea to how long the battery last on me. It last me the whole day if I were to use it on unlimited data while web browsing, calling, texting and some gaming and videos/music. I try to charge it fully to 100% and play heavy 3d games nonstop and it last me about 4hrs+. In other words, its definitely last longer than my S3 and my friend S4. #gaming- modern combat 4, NOVA 3, real racing 3, gt racing 2, dead trigger 2, nfs most wanted and others heavy 3d games are running excellent on this phone accept there are some lag here and there and that's due to poor optimization from the Dev. #4g lte- I compare the connective speed to my older bro LG G2 4g lte on T-Mobile and its about the same speed. #screen- the screen on this phone is really nice/crispy clear. Too be expected from the resolution spec. #build quality- its feel really good in the hand compare to my S3 and since i nor none of my family own an s4, I can't compare with it.# update 4-15-15# I got a chance to hold an S4 from a friends and I could say that, the S5 feel more comfortable and grip to hold onto than the S4. #touchwiz- I know some people hate the touchwiz on Samsung phone but I don't really mind as long as I could get things done I need too. To me, the touchwiz is much much better than my S3 and it looks like it doesn't take up too much ram like the S3. It's much faster and fluid with the help of Snapdragon 801 of course and 2gb ram. #camera- yea! No more bringing my camera with me whenever I want to take a pic! The quality of the camera on this phone is amazing! It take reallllyy good pictures! #update 4-15-15# Am loving the camera on this phone so much. There're just so many things to do to edit the picture once you have take! # In conclusion, I am glad I waited to get the S5 rather than the S4. It was worth the long wait! I'll come back and update about couple weeks later. #update- 4-13-15 #fingerprints- Its a cool feature and it does work but I find it a bothersome since I could just slide the bar in less than 1 sec while the fingerprint scanner take about 4+ sec but that's just me though. #water proof- I have finally made my decision and decide to put my S5 in a cold/hot water for 1 minutes straight and its still working normal as it is so yea, it's waterproof.",sokae,Samsung_S5,740

You CAN use the old charger from one of your old Android powered devices! Just plug it into the right side of the port, the part that looks like a micro-USB port. It just happens to charge really really quickly if you use a USB 3.0 cable, but it's not necessary to do so. THE AMAZING SCREEN First things first, this display is nicer than any I have ever seen. It is so sharp I cannot see individual pixels with my naked eye. It's also bright, very bright! It's perfectly usable on a bright sunny day at noon without a cloud in the sky. I noted that when switching between the highest setting with and without auto-brightness, the screen actually brightened more with the auto-brightness feature enabled, but only in really bright conditions! So if it's extremely bright outside, leave the auto-brightness feature enabled, it actually appears to be able to reach a higher brightness that way. The auto-brightness feature is superbly implemented anyway, so I'd recommend leaving it on regardless. I upgraded from the S3, and I immediately noticed the whiter whites, darker blacks, extremely realistic and still vibrant colors, and even the capability of dimming the screen much more effectively (which is really nice when using the phone in bed). THE INSANELY AWESOME ULTRA-POWER SAVING MODE This thing is for real. With 10 percent power left, you get usability the rest of the day. The S5 has a super amoled screen, so black pixels don't draw any power as opposed to back-lit LCD screens. Ultra-power saving mode turns the screen black and white, and gives you a jet-black interface with up to six black and white icons. It reduces the screen frame rate, shuts down two of the four cores (the phone is a quad core phone), reduces in half the speed of the remaining two cores, shuts down almost all background processes, disables most apps, and sips power all the while letting you text, call, and surf the web. You can check your email via the web, but can't use the email or gmail apps. Basically it turns your phone into one of those old flip phones that lasted forever. That's pretty sweet in a pinch! You know, those moments when you're sitting at the auto-service center, sweating bullets because you're about to embark on the Ramen noodle diet for the remainder of the year? And on top of that your phone's about to die, and all you want it to do is hang on for another few minutes so you can get the invoice and make this call: ""Honey, it's the flux capacitor. I guess a device that involves 1.21 gigawatts isn't cheap. It's gonna be 5 gazillion dollars. I think we're gonna be eating Ramen noodles for a while. Can you get one of the chili flavored packs ready for me? I'll be home in about 20 minutes. Don't let me forget to cancel the newspaper. That'll save us a few ... well, dear, I'm pretty sure we need the flux capacitor ... yes, I know ... but college isn't all that important these days anyway; they'll be fine ... Alright, will do. I love you too."" At least with the S5 you don't have to worry about your phone. It's not gonna die before you get back. Right now my phone is at 91% power. I just activated ultra-power saving mode, and it says I'd get 11.4 DAYS of standby time. I figure with regular use I'd get a week. You could literally charge your phone to 100% before a week-long vacation, flip on ultra power-saving mode, use your phone normally and probably make it the entire week without having to charge it. I'd love to test that theory. But suffice it to say that gone are the days of needing to worry about a dead phone when you're out all day and don't have access to a charger. THE SECURITY OF A FINGERPRINT SCANNER It takes some getting used to, but once you set up your fingerprints, you can easily activate the phone by swiping your finger or thumb (I set mine up for one-handed use",Brian Herro,Samsung_S5,741

I shopped around for the best deal and pre-ordered it at a local store. I really liked the phone initially. The fingerprint scanner is a great feature. I had no problems with the response or speed of the phone. Still had some network issues with calls but, I'm use to it with Sprint. After all that, I discovered that this phone does not allow you to Talk & Surf at the same time. For the entire week, I was on a call and made several attempts to get on the internet or do something data related and I would get a ""no connection"" error. I thought there must be a setting I was missing, so I tried changing the networks to all that was available (CDMA, LTE/CDMA, GSM, Automatic). Each time, I would make a phone call and try the internet and it never worked. Which means, there's no Facebooking, Instagraming, Hangouts, Google Maps/Search, BBM, Twitter, GroupMe...NOTHING data related while on a call. The only time it works is when the phone is connected to a Wi-Fi zone. This was UNACCEPTABLE for me! Hence, the reason I gave it 2 stars. I upgraded from an S3 to the S5 and never had an issue with surfing the net while on a call on my S3. I Talk & Surf everyday. Apparently, this phone was developed with the new 'Spark LTE' network which does not allow Talk & Surf. You can only do one at a time due to a hardware change in the phone from dual band to single band. If you're in the middle of downloading, uploading, surfing, etc., and a call comes in, the phone will immediately cut off your data and will not resume until you end the call. I Googled this issue and it is legitimate based on Sprint Community Forums. Also, I contacted the local Sprint store and they verified this as well. Therefore, I returned the S5 before my grace period was up and got the Note 3 instead. Now, I can Talk & Surf again!! If Talk & Surf is important to you as it is to me, I suggest that you stick with the S3, S4, or the Notes. Stay away from any phone that says ""Spark LTE"" until Sprint fixes it.","CocoComplexion ""SexyNavy""",Samsung_S5,742

While the instructions say to swipe straight downwards, it is actually possible to register your fingerprint at an angle. Do it correctly, and unlocking it one-handed becomes easy. Here's someone who made a video of this: [...] - After a full day of super intense use, the battery is usually left at around 25-35%. This is far better than previous phones I've had. - The camera is excellent in daylight, decent in low-light situations. However, the daytime photos are stunningly good, gorgeous even. - plastic is grippy in hand, looks better in person than in pictures. - used in rain for a solid 30 minutes, the phone received a thorough soaking and still worked perfectly. water resistant claims hold true. Do note, though, that you must have the back cover on properly so that it can create a waterproof seal. - S health is useful if you make use of it. It can track interesting metrics such as the amount of calories you burn in a day, and the amount you walk around in your daily routine. However, the phone does occasionally get inaccurate readings. A vast majority of the time, though, it works fine. - swappable battery is HUGE. You know how your battery gets worn down over a two year contract, and by the time your contract is up, your battery life sucks so you need to replace your ENTIRE phone? Well, you can just replace the battery with a brand new one, and BAM, battery life back to as if it was new. - TV remote is cool and can be useful - Ultra-power saving mode, when on, can extend battery life to (claimed by Samsung) 10 or so full days. Let me repeat: 10 FULL days. I've tested it for one day, and the entire day killed only about 8-10% battery. Do the math and, well, it seems to fit. - One-handed operation can be done, and Samsung has created a few neat tricks to operate one-handed. Use one-handed modes when you need it, enjoy the larger (and gorgeous) screen when you don't need to use it one-handed. - AMOLED Screen for the S5, according to Displaymate's tests, is the BEST ever made. Anandtech also claims that the screen is pretty much superior in nearly every aspect to it's LCD counterparts. But you should see it for yourself, it is absolutely gorgeous and works well in full daylight conditions. - USB 3.0 port is BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE with your older chargers. You just need to plug in your older chargers into the right side of the port at the bottom. USB 3.0 port also means that, with the proper charger, it charges faster than any other phone on the market. Also, you can get usb 3.0 speeds for transfers, which can be anywhere from 2x-5x faster than usb 2.0 speeds (note, usb 3.0 only works with Windows at the moment). - MicroSD supports up to 128gb. I don't think anything else needs to be said. - Android is less restrictive than IOS, but they're both still good operating systems. Choose the one that fits you best. Cons: - speaker could be improved - camera, while amazing, does have some gimmicky features that can be ignored - USB 3.0 is cool, but bottom flap to cover it is not cool. I'd say look into getting a wireless charger ASAP, so you don't have to worry about the stupid flap. To be fair, though, the flap is needed for the IP67 water and dust resistance that the S5 has. - Touchwiz can be a pain sometimes, but for the most part, it doesn't detract from the overall experience Look up ""Ultimate Samsung Galaxy S5 Water Test"" on Youtube if you want to see the Galaxy S5 survive through both a 1m deep swimming pool, and a full cycle in a washing machine. Will update as I use the phone more. Edit: Pro - You could actually use a pencil/pen with the phone, as long as you enable high-screen-sensitivity in the settings. With a screen protector on the phone, I can now write/draw stuff fairly accurately. There's no palm rejection like the Note 3, but it's still a nice option to have when needed. Pro - phone notification window, where you can minimize incoming c",Aaron L,Samsung_S5,743

Due to an unlimited data contract, I had opted to continue on through the S4 and just now decided to lose my unlimited data by upgrading to the S5. I must say, losing unlimited data is absolutely worth it. Likes The remote control feature. I have a horrendous habit of leaving my TV remote across the room. The IR sensor makes changing the channel possible with my phone. It also linked up to my cable provider to show me what is playing, and changes my TV to that particular channel. Gimmicky? Maybe, but I love it. Fingerprint security - very fast. Not as good as iPhone 5S, but still very viable as a means of security. Hopefully will be opened up to other apps and services, such as Google. A lot of people complain that you must be very accurate while moving your finger across the sensor. I have moved my thumb straight up and down as well as tilted 90 degrees and successfully unlocked my phone. In fact, the only angle I haven’t been able to unlock my phone is by having my thumb oriented upside down. Battery - I haven't had the opportunity to extensively test the battery life yet. However, worth ultra power saving mode on (turns off non essential apps and makes the screen greyscale) the phone reports 10 days of battery life with an 84% charge. IP67 - No dust, no water! I love feeling a little more safe around water. Although the charge port cover is quite annoyingly in the way when it's open. Camera is one of the best I’ve ever used on a smartphone. Clear, crisp pictures and a FAR more intuitive UI than I experienced on the Galaxy S3. The only complaint I have is that it takes a few seconds for the camera to start, which makes it hard to catch impromptu moments! Fantastic call quality. Beautiful screen. 5.1in full HD Super AMOLED Dislikes The capacitive button to the left of the physical button no longer handles settings/menu. Now it’s your multitasking button. My S3 handled multitasking by long pressing the physical button. It’s a small dislike, and something I’m sure I’ll get used to. But I don’t like it for now. Verizon has disabled the use of the download booster mode which allows 4G and Wifi to act together to enable faster downloads. Bloatware. This is becoming a staple with smartphones, and you can disable almost all bloatware in Android. It does still annoy me! No Lockscreen Widgets. At the time of this writing, it is impossible to add lockscreen widgets. Also, if you customize the current lockscreen, you lose the ability to have fingerprint security. The Fence Still plastic +Makes the phone lighter -Feels more prone to break Heart-rate Monitor -Gimicky. I don’t think it will see a lot of use, but only time will tell. Overall: It's a great phone with some very minor issues. If you're upgrading from the S4, I'd skip it, but anything older, and you should absolutely get in on it!","R. B.

I especially love the built-in power saving features. Kept my phone going for a 9 day camping trip, with just one recharge from a portable battery. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the camera.

I upgraded from my S3 to the S5 for Sprint and thought I'd have more capabilities. Turns out with Sprints new Spark network stuff that isn't the case. I don't know all the technical reasons, but for the time being on the S5 w/ Sprint you are not able to be on the phone and use the internet unless you are connected to WIFI. That means no driving and using the GPS and talking to someone simultaneously. To me that was complete garbage and reason enough to return the phone. The final straw was the fact that Sprint hasn't upgraded their towers in the STL area, so when I swapped phones I would no longer get 4G in STL. My S3 had no problem accessing it, but this new Spark thing really screwed up my connection on the S5. I'm sure eventually it will be fixed, but I didn't feel like paying for an upgraded phone to have diminished capabilities for who knows how long.",Tom,Samsung_S5,748

I posted on Facebook that I felt like I was the last person in the USA to get a cell phone. Someone responded to that post, ""You were!"" By April of 2014 I was feeling like the only person in the USA without a smart phone. Even my dad had upgraded from a flip phone to a smart phone! So I took the plunge and got the then just released Samsung Galaxy S5. Upgrading from a texting phone to this smart phone has been an amazing experience. I wasn't sure if it would be worth the extra cost for a smart phone, as I didn't think I would use the ""smart"" functions that much, but boy was I wrong! I use the phone for a lot of things I hadn't planned on or even thought of. For instance, I go for walks regularly for my morning cardio. Previously I used an old-fashioned watch and a clip-on pedometer to measure my duration and distance, but now I use the exercise timer and pedometer on the S5, and I think it is more accurate than the pedometer. When I am away from my desktop PC, I use the S5 to check Facebook, Twitter, and Google News (my primary new source). I use the Smart Remote ap to turn my Toshiba 40-Inch LED TV on and off when the DVR is recording something, as I have the cable remote set to turn both the TV and DVR on and off at the same time. I jot reminders down in the Memo ap and keep appointments in the Calendar ap. I regularly check the weather with the AccuWeather ap. And I am becoming a real camera buff, whereas I rarely took pictures before; but it is so easy with the S5, and I always have it with me, so why not? And once I started downloading aps, that really opened the door for more stuff to use the S5 for. There was a free Bible ap, ""You Version,"" available in the Play Store, so it was the first ap I downloaded. It works great and has many versions available including the NKJV, my favorite Bible version. I then downloaded a couple of Bible trivia aps, so I now use my S5 for reading and studying the Bible. Then in May I got lost in downtown Pittsburgh coming home from visiting my nephew, so I downloaded MapQuest's GPS ap, and that has been working great at keeping me from getting lost again. After I got my Roku 3500R Streaming Stick (HDMI), I download the Roku remote ap. That is much easier to use than the Roku remote when tying in data, like my user name and password for the Roku or searching for programs in Amazon's Instant Video. Then I downloaded aps for my favorite sports teams: the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Steelers, and Penn State. So I check schedules, stats, and other info on them on the S5. I downloaded the Weather Channel's ap for another ""opinion"" on the weather (although I've found AccuWeather to be more accurate). And most recently, I downloaded a ""white noise"" ap to use if I take a nap during the day (I use a LectroFan White Noise Machine at night, as the ap doesn't cancel out noise as much as the LetroFan does). I know this might all be basic stuff to you long-time smart phone users, but for those of us new to this technology, it is truly astonishing. Since this is my first smart phone, I cannot say how it compares to other smart phones. But I can comment on a couple of points I've seen mentioned in reviews of the S5. The first issue is the battery life. With my old texting phone, I only had to charge it up a couple of times a week, but I then I do not make too many phone calls or send very many texts. With the S5, I'm charging it about every other day. But with as many things as I use it for, I don't think that is unreasonable. As long as it lasts a full day, I'd be happy. Second, it is true that you can not multi-task with it. If I were to get a phone call while on my morning walk, I would need to pause the exercise timer to answer it. But no matter, as I'd probably do that anyway. I have had a couple of problems with it. First, a while ago, I was trying to listen to KLove (a Christian radio station) via their Web site on the S5's speaker whi","Gary F.

The battery life for me is one of the big ones but of course the camera, display, speed of the processor, and overall refinements of it's functions are some of the other improvements. I like android because the alternative (apple) makes you use their software and hardware for everything as well as having an internal battery that when it starts to fail it is a major issue. Did I mention that it's waterproof? That is really cool. Especially since her S2 kicked it when she accidentally dropped it in water.",Fern,Samsung_S5,763

I really wanted Swype and to have a bigger screen and faster processing. I am by no means a techie, just someone that uses her phone for everything and wanted a change. I am writing this review for laymen like me. The Galaxy S5 does not disappoint. Pros: This phone is great. The camera blows iPhone's away. It's fast and I can have several apps open at the same time and it doesn't slow it down. The colors are so vivid and websites, photos, and games are crisp. I love the apps that I've found, including an app called Optimize that allows the user to maximize their battery life with a click of a button. I watch videos and read books on this phone and the screen is the perfect size. It's also not too bulky, as the phone itself is pretty slender. Another big difference are the widgets, which give you easy access to your favorite apps, and the ease with which the phone syncs with my Google calendar. I also love the Google Now feature, which can be accessed by holding down the center button and gives you a rundown of your day, scores from the game, recommendations based off your recently viewed, websites. I have had this phone a month and am still discovering things about it. Cons: The battery does drain pretty quickly, if you are using it all day like I am. But on the upside, there is an easy way to switch your phone to power saving mode (I've done that and had it last a day and a half with no charge). There are a lot of apps that come with the phone, many of which are similar to one another. My biggest gripe is that the charger on this model is different than the Galaxy S4 and most other models, so I recommended buying an additional charger or cord now. Finally, there was a pretty big learning curve, so just prepare to be frustrated at first. It goes away, I promise. Overall, I am extremely happy with this phone!",Tina S,Samsung_S5,768

At one point the 5s became unbearable: incredibly poor battery life, stupid restrictions on customization, unavoidable steps to reach certain functions that I routinely use, and a definite reduction in quality (that mushy home button). Went ahead and paid full price for a Galaxy S5. Oh dear, I wish I had started here from the beginning. This phone is better in every way. Faster, better battery, superb battery management, deeply customizable,... now I can do what I want the way I want and not the way Apple thinks I have to do it. The only thing I would add is about design. For some reason that escapes me some people say that this phone looks cheap. I beg to differ. I found this phone clearly elegant. If you want to know what ugly and kitchs look like have a look at the iPhone 6 (or 6 plus for that matter): that is what I call a joke of design.

I am so glad I made the switch to the Samsung s5! The quality of the phone is all around beautiful! It moves fast and does not freeze or crash! The graphics are beautiful and the sound is crisp and clear (HD). The features are so easy to get use to and very convient. And the camera takes beautiful pictures and video. Honestly I can not put this phone down since I got it. I am in love with the finger print lock option it let's me know my phone is secured and I can also make purchases with my finger tip! Awesome! The battery give a good 9 hours before it hits 30% to 40% battery time left which is awesome compared to most phones. And you can get more time with the powersave mode.

Good call quality, usually better signal strength, faster app execution, longer battery life. Camera is okay, but a few quirks, especially with my bank's app - framing the check is harder and it sometimes won't focus properly on the back side of the check (no lines near the center to focus upon). This is minor and I've adjusted (and perhaps the bank app has upgraded, too?). My only knock is that the security fingerprint unlock is not really ready for everyday use.

I have 5 times more apps and music on the galaxy -you don't need an itunes account -the graphics are wayyyyyy better. It's like a mini HD TV (great for the netflix lovers!) -the camera is much better for videos -it's supposedly water resistant for those that accidentally drop their phones in the toilet. I know too many girls with too-tight pockets that lose their phones this way, so this is a great phone for girls or women who wear tight jeans -fingerprint password is cool -lighter Now what's annoying about it? -I don't know if I can get rid of galaxy gifts and galaxy essentials. The ad for it takes up half my background and I don't find it useful. -it's been crashing from certain apps. How does one small app crash a phone with a hell of a lot more power than the first spaceship? -you need a light on to plug the charger into the phone because the slit is tiny BE WARNED! If you are switching from iphone to android, know that imessages will still go to your old iphone, even after it's been deactivated. Anybody with an iphone that imessages you (which is btw often automatic with iphones) will send a text to your old phone and your new phone WILL NOT GET IT UNTIL THEY MAKE IT A REGULAR SMS. I activated my galaxy myself instead of going to Sprint, so maybe they would have fixed that for me. But Apple is sketchy, so be sure to ask and make sure.",aleesh91,Samsung_S5,811

The reception is terrible, much worse than my previous phone which was the S III. Occasionally Data, GPS or WiFi will stop working until the phone is restarted. If you had it for more than 30 days then Amazon will not help you. Sprint will not help you unless you are paying for insurance, you should not have to insure your phone at $11/month against it breaking. This is what warranty is for. I tried chatting with Samsung, but I gave up, as it was taking 15 minutes for customer service to respond to every line in the chat.

Let me suggest something for the next update from each of these parties: Please include the ability to enable/disable all of your ""cool"" ideas. (And do not tell your boss that you do when you only do some.) For example, Samsung recently shuffled the set of software features between S4 and S5. Some good idea such as lock screen apps disappeared with other not so good things such as trial subscriptions were added. The core problem is that Samsung removes the original ability within Google Android to selectively disable (turn off) apps. It is great that Samsung tries to filter forward a set of interesting apps; Please allow me to disable or enable those apps that you filter forward. For example, Sprint (Softbank) continues to press in app purchase of subscription for voicemail to text conversion. The nagware in Sprint voicemail has no option to disable the nagging even though they think they have some basic options. Sprint has outsourced voicemail as a profit center. It is truly pressing boundaries for Sprint to insert advertisements in voicemail. Please allow me to turn off the nagware. How many times does one have to opt out? Let's encourage them to get a firmware update that benefits we their paying consumers so we can turn off the in app purchases and advertisements.",darwin,Samsung_S5,835

I went back to my Note 3 because I do a lot of tethering. Pros: -The new TouchWiz interface is clean. The floating/pop up box for incoming calls is great and doesn't take up the whole screen. -The camera is very clear. As a photographer, I am happy with the camera for use in well-lit conditions. -Battery life is great. I usually get extra batteries but the Ultra Power Saving mode has got me holding off on purchasing extra batteries. -The design looks cheap. The chrome bezel looks much cheaper and rounded than on the Note 3. -The screen is bright, sharp and looks great. Cons: -Low-light camera shots are disappointing. -No camera optical image stabilization, which is becoming a standard feature in high-end smartphones. -MTP via USB 3.0 can be buggy and has its limitations. It takes a few minutes to do simple tasks like renaming folders. USB 3.0 isn't on by default and takes three extra steps. Once on, it reverts to 2.0 after four minutes. -The water-resistant cover is flimsy and gets in the way. It would be nice if they made it water-resistant like the 3.5mm plug. -The fingerprint scanner makes it easier to unlock the phone but is tricky to use. It lets you register 3 fingers with about 10 imprints on each, so you can technically register about 30 different angles for multiple fingers. I registered my thumb at different angles so it would recognize it in one swipe. Still no fingerprint shortcuts to apps, etc. -The bezels around the screen are wide, making the screen look smaller than it really is.",NT,Samsung_S5,870

He was going to swap the phone thinking that I bought it from BESTBUY, but when he found out the phone was purchased from AMAZON, he told me that I need to contact AMAZON. I had a chat session, a phone session and an email telling me that "" Sorry it may be disappointed for me to hear but you just need to contact Samsung"" .

For one thing, this phone feels bulky. I don't know if it was because I was used to the S3, but it just felt awkward and squarish to me. The HTC One M8 not only looks nicer but felt more comfortable to hold when I saw it in store. The HTC also sports front-facing speakers and has very clear sound quality, while the S5 seems muffled because its speakers are in the back (why they are in the back, I do not know). After powering the phone on and doing the initial setup, I opened up the camera. I took a couple test shots using the normal back camera, and then I tried out the front camera. To my surprise, the picture was distorted! It stretched the top and bottom parts of the frame and creates an odd, enlongated appearance. A quick google search revealed that other people are experiencing the same issue, and there seems to be no fix. For a premium, flagship smartphone, this is unacceptable. Perhaps for those who don't use the front camera this is probably not a big deal. But I couldn't stand looking at my stretched out face. Moving on to the lockscreen: Unlike the Galaxy S3, you cannot add lockscreen widgets such as Dashclock. I don't know why it was removed in this phone. The only thing you can change is the wallpaper and the unlock method. The finger print scanner leaves much to be desired. ""Swipe faster."" ""Swipe slower."" ""Swipe the entire pad."" are the messages that I received when trying to use it to unlock my phone. I eventually had to use my backup password. Overall, I was disappointed with the Galaxy S5. I didn't like how some features were taken out and replaced by gimmicky features such as the fingerprint scanner and the heart rate monitor. I'm in the process of exchanging it with either the HTC One M8 or the LG G3 (soon to arrive in the US).",Andrew,Samsung_S5,883

317 of 328 people found the following review helpful,5,Samsung hit the mark with this flagship. All other flagships are a step behind.,"on April 14, 2014","A little background on my love of smartphones - I used to be a major Apple fanboy from the first iphone to the iphone 5. Steve Jobs is still my hero. I made the switch when the Galaxy S4 came out, then moved to the HTC One, LG G2, Note 3, and now the Galaxy S5. I use two phones, one for work and one for personal use. I spent a decent amount of time with all of them and can say that most people would be happy with each and every flagship for daily use for 1-2 years at a minimum but most people come to read these reviews for the small details that make the major differences between just ""okay"" with your phone or ""completely happy"" with their device. I won't list out the specs of the phone since that type of info is listed everywhere. But this phone as well as the others listed here are spectacular at being fast, having good to great battery life, and all have good to great cameras. Probably the most polarizing topics of phones these days is the aesthetics, mainly due to the fact that hardware seems to have outpaced the software which means manufacturers cant really make phones noticeably faster than the previous generation. Okay I'll get to the review. Metal vs. Plastic - The HTC One and the iPhone are made from mostly aluminum. Aluminum without question looks fantastic on phones. The colors also look much better on aluminum because they can be anodized giving them a rich and even color that just look great. The main problem with metal is, sure it looks great on day one, but the material is so hard that is super easy to scratch and nick without ever dropping it. I am the type of user who hates cases. They add thickness and overall just make the phone look ugly, and to top it all off, cases are 40 to 50 dollars for a piece of plastic(major rip off). I carry my phone in my left front pocket without anything else in there to scratch it. After a good months use of the iPhone 5 and HTC one, i developed so many nicks and scratches that it really made me question, ""Is metal really so great?"" The answer is no. Have you ever seen someone with an uncovered black iPhone? After 6 months the sides look silver just from normal wear and tear. Most people who will read this review probably haven't seen an uncovered HTC One mainly because the volume of sales isn't there, but that phone has the same problem. Sure the metal is gorgeous, but it is only on the first day. And what is the point of buying a phone for it's looks if you're going to cover it in a PLASTIC case? Plastic - At first try with the S4 and LG G2, I HATED plastic. The glossy feeling made the phone feel slippery and cheap in my hand. And to top it off, glossy plastic attracts oil like white on rice, which just makes your phone feel nasty at times(or maybe I just have gross hands which I don't think I do because I am a scientist and wash my hands 10-20 times a day). But then the Note 3 came out with faux leather plastic. Sure it's not pretty like aluminum, but it's light weight, it has a nice texture, it doesn't attract oil, and it doesn't nick and scratch like metal. Maybe Samsung is onto something with plastic. Everyone seems so concerned with the way phones look vs how they feel or hold up over time. I can say without a doubt, my Note 3 looks the same way it did out of the box after a few months of hard usage. For the S5 they switched from the glossy plastic on the S4 to a textured dimpled plastic that feels slightly soft, which I think feels fantastic. It is slightly softer with a more grippy feel and it doesn't look at all tacky. I love it. The phone definitely feels sturdy in your hand. Software - The general perception of Android is that it is harder to use than iOS. After using iPhones for 5 years(iPads and macs), and now Android for just over a year, I can say that perception is absolutely false and anyone who says it probably has not given Android a fair chance. In fact, I think Android is easier to use than iOS. With google now built into the phone, it is always listening",D. Miyao,Samsung_S5,916

As other people are saying, one of the big surprises is the battery life. I went two and a half days of heavy use and still had 20% when I charged it. A few of the bells and whistles feel superfluous, but many of the new features are ones I want. For example, scheduled text messaging is fantastic. At 5:00 AM I can work my text messages and have my responses sent at 8:00. Or scheduling a text to send on someone's birthday is pretty cool. The screen is beautiful. The colors are bright and crisp. The feel of the phone is nice, too--not to heavy, but not so light it feels fragile. It impresses me also that I can use the new adapter for enhanced charging or my old charger if need be. That's the kind of smart design that sells me on upgrading. The only couple things I don't care for are: 1) the cover to the adapter jack is hard to open and 2) the fingerprint scanner takes 2-3 swipes usually to recognize my finger. Apart from that, I'm very happy with my S5.",W. Fondren,Samsung_S5,917
23 of 25 people found the following review helpful,4,Amazing phone upgrade from iPhone 4s,"on May 23, 2014","After 2 weeks with the Samsung Galaxy S5, here is a *short* review for those thinking about upgrading. *Note I switched from an iphone 4S running IOS 6* Looks: The phone is very aesthetically pleasing. Though it is still a plastic casing, it does not feel cheap by any means. The dimpled back plate provides a great grip, making single handed operation easy. It is as sleek as it is sexy. The chrome edges are slightly raised providing screen protection that apple really should look into considering how many cracked screens you see with the iphones. DURABILITY: I titled this in all caps because I want to emphasize how durable this thing is. I've not dropped it too many times and the screen is wrapped in a GLASS screen protector. However, the drops that have occurd have not scratched any part of the phone. The best part is that the water proof housing is legit. The only issue is water gets trapped in the headphone jack and must be blown out. You also cannot make phone calls under water, but that is due to the water blocking your signal so that does not deduct anything from it. Screen: Absolutely beautiful. There is little to no glare and the screens auto brightness works perfectly. Plenty big enough to watch Netflix in bed. Videos are so crisp compared to the iphone. Camera: 16 megapixels + Loads of software for image correction and stabilization makes for a camera better than most off the POS cameras. Also, the front camera more than sufficient for you selfie lovers. Battery: I must say, the battery life is quite impressive for the processing power that this thing puts out. I've used it pretty intensely and yet to have it get below 5%. When it did get to 8% and I didn't have a charger, I threw it into Ultra-Power saving mode and it lasted 15 hours with minimal use until I got back to my apartment. Oh, and it was still at 6% battery. IOS to KitKat: The biggest fear for most seems to be learning a new mobile OS. I will be the first to say, it takes some adjusting. IOS made me lazy, but once you learn how to traverse the GUI you'll be asking yourself how you made it so long on IOS. So many features that you never knew were possible on a phone. It literally is a Mobile Computer. I mean, it can run an emulator without any hacks or jail-breaking. Features: - The health monitoring feature is pretty awesome for the active-lifestyle people. The heart rate monitor is a tad finicky, but accurate. Now that I have the hang of it, I rarely encounter issues. - The pedometer is pretty sweet. Set a daily goal and it keeps you informed on your status. Who knew I walked 10 miles on a 14 hour shift. - I haven't used the cal counter but I'm sure it could be handy. All of the SHealth data is plotted so you can see a nice lay out of your day and track progress. - The finger print reader is ""Eh"". I've been using it for a week. Makes one handed operation hard. I'm more of a fan of the pattern lock. If you could use the combo of the pattern lock and the fingerprint scanner I would utilize it a lot more. Overall, I am more than pleased with my switch the the S5. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone older than an iphone 5/ Galaxy S4. For those currently using the iphone 5 or S4, I wouldn't rush to upgrade as it would not be much of an upgrade. From a iphone 4s to the S5 though, the differences are incredible!",Jacob Colby,Samsung_S5,918

15 of 17 people found the following review helpful,4,Fingerprint reader is disabled if you encrypt device (all carriers),"on April 21, 2014",I have been using my new S5 for a few days now and am very impressed with this device. However I just found a flaw in its use of the fingerprint reader that I found quite disturbing and I have since verified with Samsung directly that this is the way it is designed. The issue is that if you encrypt your device all of the lock screen options go away except for password. In other words if you want to encrypt your device the fingerprint reader is effectively disabled. Samsung told me they would forward my concern on this to engineering but I think buyers should know about this. If you don't intend to encrypt your phone this is not an issue and I would admit most people probably don't. (though more should IMO) The camera on this phone is fantastic by the way.,"J. brown ""jb from the lbc""",Samsung_S5,920

I got this phone (6/3/14) from an authorized AT&T dealer in my town. I wanted to get on here and leave a quick review. I LOVE this phone, but Adobe Flash is not supported and there is no way to play Amazon Instant Prime Video. I'm quite upset over this. This phone would be PERFECT if it could do everything the iphone can do (without being an Apple product lol). It's really unfortunate. Luckily, I have an iPod and a PS3 (and a laptop, obviously) so it's not THAT big of a deal. I just wish I had a device that I could watch my Amazon Instant Video on that didn't require wifi. P.s.

19 of 23 people found the following review helpful,5,Versus HTC ONE M8,"on April 12, 2014","I have only had this phone for a day but I absolutely love it. I owned the HTC ONE M8 for a few weeks and returned it for the S5. Without getting into insane technical comparison, I've listed some subjective comparison points. - Build: The M8 is a thing to behold. As people say, you haven't seen the phone until you've held it. That said, I was scared to death to scratch or drop the thing. I'm not a case guy at all and a part of me dies when I see someone slap a huge Otterbox case around a magnificent piece of hardware. To each his own. I understand people are clumsy and drop things, but I get irritated when 'fanboys' trash a rival manufacturers build....but then put an enormous case on theirs. Anyways, I just prefer the lighter plastic build of the S5. The back cover feels great in the hand and the buttons are all placed in the most convenient spots (for me anyway). I appreciated HTC moving the power button to the right-top side....but it's still very difficult to reach. I've changed phones a lot in recent years and one thing I've learned is that you need a solid week or two with a phone to really form an opinion on a build. Battery: Seems pretty even here. Both get excellent battery life that you'll get entire day out of. Really excited for the wireless charging covers to be released. Don't think people know how convenient wireless charging is if their device allows for it....especially if you have to remove a cover every time you want to connect a cable (which I know isn't the end of the world, but it's the little things, right??) Unless you're some crazy heavy user that plays games all day and watches movies on a 5"" device.....you'll love the battery life. Camera: GS5 takes this one but not by much. For normal day to day Instagram photos, both devices are excellent. The selfie front camera on the HTC One was surprisingly awesome! Felt like they should have used that lenses for the back. Keep in mind this phone take high res pictures that turn into large files.....so send with caution. (5-6mb files) TouchWiz: I typically DESPISE Touchwiz. I've used a Note 1, 2, 3, Galaxy S3, S4...and now S5. This is the first time I've actually considered it a viable option to stock Android. Samsung has definitely cleaned things up. My favorite fixes include the messaging app. They've changed in subtle ways to bring it up to date. Kit Kat allows you to choose your default messaging app now (which is awesome!) but this is the first time I've wanted to stick with the stock app. (priority senders is a cool option) Speakers: The BoomSound speakers obviously crush the GS5 here. However, unless this is a feature that you absolutely need....the GS5 speakers are serviceable. I found it very fun to show off the HTC speakers to friends.....but in normal day to day life I keep my phone silenced almost the entire time. (nobody can stand hearing your notification sound go off constantly). ALSO, nobody has brought this up, but when you leave the HTC ONE M8 in your pocket any kind of small dust or dirt particles get jammed in the speaker grill!!!! I wish I could attach a photo of this but it was irritating! That freshly drilled speaker hole look goes away in about a few days. Tried blowing on it but didn't seem to work. Just a heads up. Misc: Wish the headphone jack was on the bottom. Had gotten used to that on other devices. Conclusion: Just wanted to give a few points to those on the fence. You can't go wrong with either phone. It really comes down to build quality. The HTC was something that will definitely turn heads and feel nice and cold in the morning, but remember that summer is coming up. The GS5 will be much more friendly in the elements. Hope this helps.",phillydet000,Samsung_S5,922
7 of 7 people found the following review helpful,5,Great Phone,"on May 15, 2014","I used the iPhone and other Apple devices since I've used cell phones, and I always liked them. When this phone came out and it was time to conveniently upgrade, I took the plunge into the Android world. I have a Macbook Pro, Air, and an iPad Air, and was nervous about how I would like an Android and if I would be able to get used to it fast enough. A little over a month later, I am in love with this phone (and was since I turned it on). Apple's iOS gets a lot of attention for being simple and pretty, but this phone (Android) makes tasks that would take three or four actions on an iPhone take only one or two. There are more customizable features, you can delete preinstalled apps, it is faster and has a great screen on it. For me a big selling point was larger real estate on the screen. It is fantastic and is great for reading, watching sports, gaming, etc. Much preferable to the iPhone. When I hold an iPhone, it feels much smaller, and very comfortable, but I find myself missing so many features that I am now accustomed to on my GS5. There are a few cons, such as a few recurring notifications (volume control and power down) that I don't need and can't turn off, but everything else is seamless.",Rose,Samsung_S5,923
6 of 6 people found the following review helpful,5,Awesome in most things.,"on July 23, 2014","My first Android phone and I am satisfied with one notable exception. I am a 7 year iPhone user. Switching to Android took some adjustments but I am happy to say that Galaxy S5 is better than my iPhone 5 in many aspects, but not quite as good in two aspects. What I like about Android is that it is flexible. Android is open source so each manufacturer can make adjustments to the generic Android OS. With the S5, Samsung has made Android little more useful than the generic version. Samsung has introduced many in-house software for photos, phone, emails, and texts. The result is some very useful features such as regularly updating the local weather and showing it on the front screen, dual zone international clock, quick location/wifi/blutooth on/off switches etc. What I really like about this phone are two things: the screen and the battery life. The screen is simply stunning with colors that really pop out. It is full HD (1080p) and even the smallest icons show their details. All games come fully to life. The battery on this phone with regular use lasts me around 36 hours. That is about 12 hours more than what I get out of iPhone 5 with comparable usage. I initially had some reservations about the size of this phone. I am happy to say this phone is not too big. But I wouldn't want my phone to be any bigger or else I would need to buy pants with bigger pockets. What I don't like about this phone are two things: mediocre image stabilization in its camera and the clunky music player. I took several pictures with this phone and few images came out blurry. Sometimes I took repeated photos and they still came out blurry. Plus, the pictures came out fairly grainy. In my opinion, the camera on S5, especially its image stabilization, is not as good as the one found on iPhone 5 and 5S. I also did not like the music player. The iPhone, in my view, was designed to be a music player from its very inception. This is apparently not so true for Android. Synchronizing iTune music with Android requires separate software purchases (iSyncr for me) and is a definite downgrade from the iTune synchronization with the iPhone. Plus, my car audio does not recognize my Samsung S5 as a ""USB Music Player"". My iPhone 5 worked seamlessly with my car audio. I still can, however, play music on my car audio using the Samsung S5's blutooth feature. But the sound quality isn't quite good as the USB plug-in. Pros (compared to iPhone 5): 1)Awesome battery life. 36+ hours for me. 2)Awesome screen. Independent tests showed this screen to be the best ever tested (3 months ago), and I believe it. 3)5.1 inch screen is perfect and makes the phone lot more usable. Browsing the web and using apps on this phone is a superior experience to the iPhone 5. 4)Android offers lot more flexibility and adjustments to the user's preferences. 5)Performance is very snappy and significantly better than the iPhone 5. 6)It is waterproof. I have no problems taking this on water related sports such as white-water rafting. Cons (compared to iPhone 5): 1)Image stabilization of the camera is definitely a downer. I had more blurry images with this phone in 2 months than I had with my iPhone 5 in 18 months. Plus, the picture quality is not quite as good as the iPhone 5. Megapixels be damned, I would MUCH rather take pictures with the iPhone 5. 2)Music player is clunky and is incompatible with many car audio systems. Synchronizing music with iTunes can be clunky and needs an after-market software which costs around $5. Even worse, trying to play music via car audio using USB cable simply does not work for me. I can, however, use the blutooth to play music, which has an inferior sound quality. 3)Micro SD card (for extra storage) is significantly slower than internal flash drives. I am using top-of-the-line Samsung micro SD card.","Jaewoo Kim ""OB-Wan""",Samsung_S5,924
7 of 8 people found the following review helpful,4,On the Fence...,"on May 5, 2014","My wife and i recently purchased the Galaxy S5 and coming from IPhone I have to say i'm on the fence about keeping them. I enjoy the ease of use of the Iphone, it makes everything simple and quick. On the other hand i like the customization options on the Galaxy S5. I can't help feel like i'm being ripped off every time i get an IPhone. $100 for an extra 16GB of storage is crazy. An extra $100 on the Galaxy S5 would get me a 128GB Micro SD card bringing the total storage to 144GB. My biggest irritation is that there is NO AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO APP(Amazon i hope you read this!) but i don't hold that against the Galaxy S5. PROS Screen - The screen is outstanding. Usually Super AMOLED displays are terrible in sunlight but Samsung did a great job making it work. Everything pops and playing games and watching movies on this device is outstanding. Built Quality - Usually I would knock a phone for being plastic but it works well for this device. The phone is very comfortable to hold and the water/dust resistance is a great bonus. The black model looks pretty good as well. Battery - The battery life is good. On a typical day i take the phone off the charger at 5:45am and put it back on the charger around 11pm. I do some web browsing, text messaging, push email to a Gmail and Exchange account and watch about 35 minutes of Hulu or Netflix. Also, the phone is set to auto brightness. By the time i put the phone on the charger it's at about 10%. CONS TouchWiz - TouchWiz is garbage. I can't be any nicer about it. Both my wife's phone and my phone have froze during phone calls. It simply just goes to a black screen and stays there. To fix the issue the battery needs to be removed for a couple seconds. Same with the Message app. Upon rebooting after the message app fails it tends to send the message you were trying to send at least 10 times in a row. I would understand if the phone was rooted or it was just a third party app giving me trouble but these are core functions of the phone that aren't working correctly. In my opinion the TouchWiz skin takes a good OS and trashes it. Fingerprint Reader - The fingerprint reader is an unfinished and worthless addition to the phone. Trying to use it one handed is a waste of time as it will only work about 10 percent of the time if you try to do a vertical one handed swipe with your thumb. Using it with your pointer finger will give better result, maybe 60 percent success, but requires both hands. Heart rate Monitor - This is pretty much a gimmick to begin with. It works about 75% of the time in my experience. Probably not a deal breaker as I don't see many people ever using it. UPDATE: The freezing issues were caused by the default message app. Having it opened caused the dialer and other apps to freeze. Switching the default to Hangouts fixed the issue. Still not good that a core app doesn't work but i feel that Hangouts should be the default anyways.",Justin B.,Samsung_S5,925
3 of 3 people found the following review helpful,4,"Great phone, but","on June 21, 2014","I haven't had this long, but I'm really liking it, so far. I could still make a long list of cons, but it wouldn't be as long as my list of pros. The main thing I want to concentrate on is all the dumb apps that AT&T and Samsung feel obligated to push on it's customers. I thought Samsung was getting away from doing that years ago, but my last few phones have been Motorola's and they were much better at not pushing their apps on you. It's just frustrating, because no one wants to use an app that's poorly supported and probably won't be around long, anyway. At least not when there's usually far greater alternatives out there. It takes a lot of time to filter through and identify all the junk, before finally removing it, if possible at all. The sad thing is that all the effort that goes into these apps could have been used on improving the GUI software on the phone. There are simply things that would be easy to do, that everyone would likely enjoy, such as better notification methods. I've always been disappointed in the slow development of mobile phone software, and while it's finally gotten much better in recent years, it still has much room for improvement. Update: That was my initial review and I know it was quite cynical. It's been 5 weeks and I'm still sorting through all the apps, but some of Samsung's are actually pretty good. Still too many junk apps, though. To keep this update short, I won't go through the long list of things I've fallen in love with about the Galaxy 5, along with this version of Android. But I do want to mention that I really like the default keyboard. I'm really missing my HDMI port and FM tuner from my Atrix 2, though (internet radio apps can be great, but they require bandwidth and don't have every radio station.)",rogun,Samsung_S5,926
3 of 3 people found the following review helpful,5,Samsung S5 upgrade... a true upgrade,"on June 15, 2014","I switched phones from a Droid Maxx on verizon's network to a Samsung S5 on At&t's network. I'll start off by saying I already really liked the Droid Maxx especially for its great battery life which the S5 just hasn't come close to. That is unless you factor in the different power saving modes which make up a lot of ground on how long you can push your battery. There are so many new features that come with the phone that it is almost overwhelming yet at the same time it really feels like an upgrade. Many people have already gone over the specifics so I'll just give my overall opinion. The basic settings and features that come standard with the phone are fine but once you take a closer look you can see how Samsung really tried to make this phone customization for a wide range of different lifestyles. That said, there is also a bit of a learning curve to get all the settings tailored to your needs. No bugs, and no problems with the operating system. Even though there are some settings that seem gimmicky there are certain situations I can see myself using some of them; like the wave over screen setting to scroll while cooking or any time my hands are dirty, the high sensitivity touch screen setting when I'm wearing gloves in the lab, or pause video when I look away feature when I'm taking notes on a video/lecture. I wouldn't say it's a perfect phone for everybody but there are so many options and settings that you can get pretty darn close.",Lucas,Samsung_S5,927
5 of 6 people found the following review helpful,5,An absolutely fantastic phone,"on May 19, 2014","If you've done any research about the Galaxy S5 yet, you probably found at least a few people claiming that it has very few improvements from the Galaxy S4. I can honestly say that this is not the case, and that, coming from a Galaxy S4, this is probably the best decision I could have made for an upgrade. The screen alone, if not anything else, makes the product worth buying, is critically acclaimed and has been praised as the best consumer screen available by Displaymate, a long-running display reviewer. The back has also received some negative buzz; if you've ever held the first generation Nexus 7, it's very similar to that. Personally I find that it makes holding the device much easier, and combined with Samsung's build-in ""One-handed Mode,"" the device is as convenient as ever. Ergonomically speaking, this device beats the HTC One (M8) in just about every aspect, as the M8 that I was playing with slipped out of my hands and onto the table a total of three times, at which point I had to rest it on a surface and use it like that. Samsung also included their USB 3.0 charging port on the device which comes with a special cable, but the port was made so that it can support typical Micro-USB cables as well. The camera is also out of this world, and though it takes some getting used to navigating around the different options and modes available, I think you will be impressed with how quickly it is able to focus on a subject. If you create a Samsung account, you also have other camera modes available for download from the Samsung store, some of which are somewhat gimmicky, others are pretty neat. To date, these include Animated Photo (essentially a GIF creator), Sequence shot (a slow motion viewer), Surround shot (which creates a spherical panorama), Sound & Shot (which adds a few seconds of sound to a still photo, actually kinda neat), and Sports shot (which takes pictures of fast moving objects). All of these are free, by the way, which is really cool. As of writing this review more may have been added! Using the device is super snappy and quick, and going back to my old phone I don't know how I ever survived! Only one app has ever force closed on me while using my S5, and that app was in beta so it's difficult to tell whether it was the phone or the app itself. The IR remote is also pretty cool, and the app ""The Off Button"" is recommended because it outputs every TV IR code in a sequence so your device can act as a universal off remote. Perfect for turning off loud TV's at the bar! I've also used it to remotely trigger my DSLR, a Pentax K-30, with the app ""Camera Remote"", which also works great! All in all, there's a lot to be praised about this phone, and I intend on keeping it around for a while!",J,Samsung_S5,928
5 of 6 people found the following review helpful,4,I used to be a strict Apple user until....,"on May 4, 2014",So this coming from an Apple junkie I was extremely skeptical of getting this phone and one of the primary reasons was that I have the AT&T Next program and can upgrade every year or so too a new phone. My idea was to get this phone and next year get the iPhone 6 but the 5.5 inch screen that is only going too be released later next year due to the fact that they couldn't find a suitable battery to power the phone. I saw the S5 and was pretty much drawn too it because of the way it looked. It didn't have that cheap feel that the previous galaxy's had (I've owned the S3 and the Note 2) and it looked really slim and really light. I decided to purchase this phone and I've actually been pretty happy with it (considering that the battery kind of drains pretty quick). The visuals are extremely beautiful and I can do 1080p video and it also has a 16mp camera. My one biggest problem that I had with previous Samsung phones was the enormous amount of bloat ware that was included with the phone and that obviously hasn't changed because Samsung refuse to make anything simple. The phone is extremely quick and the 4G LTE makes it extremely easy too surf and play games or run documents. It comes with a dual core 2.5 ghz processor which is pretty interesting considering barely any phones can run this type of hardware without the occasional lag and frustration but this one does really good. All in all a solid build just wish I could uninstall programs that came with it that I'll never use.,"Pedro V. ""P.Vieira""",Samsung_S5,929

7 of 9 people found the following review helpful,4,Flagship tech - stream of consciousness,"on April 21, 2014","As a mobile developer who uses a lot of handsets on iOS and Android, I am an iOS user as my primary device. The most difficult thing for me when using a large Android phone is that I find them slippery and relatively impossible to control with one hand. It continues to confound me why manufacturers continues to use slippery chromed plastic rather than attempting to have something which remotely allows you to retain a grip. Related to this is my constant tendency to unintentionally launch apps and/or navigate away from what I am doing while handling the phone thanks to the giant screen with then bezel, and super sensitive capacitive buttons. This hasn't changed a bit with the S5 - I even dialed 911 accidentally the first day I had it - but the performance, features, and display on this device are all so amazing I have been using it as my primary for the past week nonetheless. I also tend to get lost as to what app I am in, especially when using apps with ambiguous names and interfaces (like 'gallery' and 'photos' and Samsung and Google camera apps and editors which launch each other). Being constantly asked for default apps is seemingly a neverending dialog no matter how much I select 'always' - just give me some good defaults and let me change them in settings when I want. I really do feel that at some point, Android needs to bit the bullet and move away from the button arrangement and keep all the controls on-screen or limited to one button like iOS. That display - that display. My word. Its simply gorgeous and so high resolution, I haven't even been using my iPad lately - and I do feel that there will be a sweet spot with phablets where I will eventually not want to bother bringing my iPad mini with me, even though it is easier to do work on. Its also really weird that, although these phablets are outstanding to watch video on, there are so few solutions for propping the device up like the kickstand on the original EVO - much less included with the device. As for tech, the camera on this phone is amazing in terms of features, most notably the 60fps 1080p and 30 FPS UltraHD video modes - wow. Both modes look outstanding and work perfectly - iMovie handled the UltraHD video perfectly, although it only outputs 1080P movies. UltraHD is really hard to appreciate without a 4k display anyway - but while it may not be a very cinematic choice, 60FPS 1080P is just mind-blowingly realistic. I have also been using this with a Gear Fit and Fear 2, and the setup and interoperability has been flawless so far, despite the arguable value of the software. I might have seen my last day not wearing a smartwatch just for the convenience of not having to take out my phone so much. Sorry this isn't a proper review, but more of a stream of consciousness, but wanted to share my impressions of this very cool device.","Morimoto ""Morimoto""",Samsung_S5,931
2 of 2 people found the following review helpful,4,"Very Fast, Wish These Came With Owners Manual...","on August 7, 2014","My previous phone was a Samsung S2, which I really liked & intended on keeping, but the charger port went bad and it would do all sorts of bizarre things, including drain the battery in 2 hours. So I took the plunge. This is a great phone, but here's the beef & why I didn't give it 5 stars... ATT is why. I'm not singling ATT out for any particular reason other than the deceptive way they treat customers. The price you will be quoted here on Amazon is NOT the price you will actually pay. They warn you there are other fees, but will not tell you what they are other than the $40.00 initiation fee. Well, people, there are so many fees you'll pay a huge amount over the online quote. And the $80.00 a month charge for the 2 gig mobile sharing plan listed here is likewise not really what it's going to cost you. All those unlisted fees and surcharges will cost you $94.88 in the end, almost $15.00 a month, or $180.00 per year, over what you thought you were signing up for. This has gotta stop. Won't one of you politicians submit a bill requiring service providers to tell you up front EXACTLY what all the charges are going to be? This is like living in the Ukraine. That said, the S5 is a great phone. More bells & whistles than you can ever use. Samsung, why can't you pre-load all your phones with a pdf of the owners manual? That shouldn't add hardly anything to the cost & would really help your customer base. For the uninitiated, these phones come without directions, so you'd better have a PC at home so you can go to Samsung's website to see how to install the SIM & memory card, 'cause the included Quick Start Guide doesn't tell you that important procedure. The camera is a fantastic improvement over the S2. Much clearer and many cool options, but a digital camera will take much better pictures, so don't expect miracles here. The size of the lens does matter, so while the marketing data on the camera has impressive numbers, my 1994 Canon 4 meg digital camera takes exponentially clearer pictures than this phone. It's all in the lens. The phone is really thin. Take an S2, make it thinner, stretch it vertically, and you have the S5. Some complain it feels cheap. Really? Not to me. It's light, thin, and compact. Considering what this phone does, I'm impressed with it's diminutive size & weight. One change that I'm finding difficult adjusting to are the Home & Back buttons, and the new one on the left you press to dispaly which apps were recently in use. This last one is really handy, as we all tend to use mostly the same handful of apps, and this is a really quick way to open them up. The battery life is wonderful. A charge lasts me about 2 days with substantial use. The battery is about a third larger than in the S2, charges very quickly thanks to the higher tech charging plug, and even still accepts the old version of a mini usb port charger so in a pinch you can still use your old charging cables, especially if you have a car charger. I really like that.",C. Geary,Samsung_S5,932
2 of 2 people found the following review helpful,4,Made to move from IOS to Android,"on April 20, 2014","I've had the iPhone since day one (The ugly 2g!) I've always been a fan of IOS but after the last few version of both IOS and Android, I have to say I'm believing there is parity. NOTE: The AT&T phone cannot be rooted (at this point, see review date). I didn't know this at the time of purchase. I purchased my phone from AT&T for the full purchase price no contract. Pros: The camera is a vast improvement over the iPhone 5s, we have a toddler and taking pictures with this new phone has been great. Faster focus, more options and better video. Galaxy S5 – 16MP, 2MP front camera iPhone 5S – 8MP, 1.2MP front camera The screen is great, I was worried about getting a phone this big but a week later, I have no regrets. I find myself using this phone more than my tablet. The resolution is amazing and the black levels on the phone are so much deeper than the iPhone. Galaxy S5 – 5.1"" Super AMOLED, 1080 x 1920 iPhone 5S – 4"" IPS LCD,1,536 x 640 I'm only highlighting the two main pros for me, there are many others but the two above were the most important factors for me. Cons: Specifically for the AT&T Version: The phone came carrier locked even though I purchased it with no contract. The next day, however, I was able to chat with AT&T online and the rep gave me the unlock pin and instructions so my phone is now carrier unlocked. You will need a sim from another carrier to complete this process. (I used a Verizon sim from an old phone in the office and cut it fit. Worked like a charm) The plastic back cover of Samsung is taking some getting used to. I don't keep my phones in cases so I'm used to the feel of the iPhone's solid construction. Don't get me wrong the Samsung Galaxy S5's back dimpled cover does provide a good amount of grip. If you're putting this phone into a case the the construction or rather feel of the construction shouldn't be an issue. Also, a pro for the S5 is the waterproof rating (30 minutes at 1m)! That is a huge plus for me. Learning a new OS took a bit, however, there are dozens of great guides on how to make the transition from IOS to Android as painless as possible. You can get 3rd party apps to modify your desktop screens and dock to behave more like IOS if you liked the way they worked. Also, you can get the parallax functionality of the wallpaper with another 3rd party app.","S. Shah ""Hi-Fi 4 Ever""",Samsung_S5,933

I just plugged in the SIM card and searched Google for the Internet settings. It was that easy. Now I have a 4G LTE phone with a cheap phone/data plan. The phone has all the gimmicky features you could ever want. I disable most of these for the sake of battery life. I use wifi, bluetooth and location enabled. I use various chemistry apps for calculations and a stop watch to time experiments. I get a full day (8-5) on a charge. Also buying full version apps saves battery life because of the constant server queries to display ads that support free apps. Another reason for buying this phone is the guarantee of getting the new version of android. Don't forget your Antivirus. Android is an open system and you keep a lot of personal information on your phone. It just makes sense to protect yourself.",Alan D. Jones,Samsung_S5,934

Weight of the phone. Its light, but not feather light. 5 of 5 stars 2. Processor Speed. Holy cow! Smooth and fast. There simply is no delay with any application. 5 of 5 stars 3. Music Sound with Ear Phones or buds. Excellent bass and overall range. If you have a good quality set of head phones or ear buds you will really enjoy this phone's MP3 capability. 5 of 5 stars. 4. Internal speaker. Its a bit quiet probably because of the extended battery life. 3 of 5 stars 5. Screen Quality. The screen is simply beautiful and large yet its not clumsy to hold on to. 5 of 5 stars 6. WiFi Range. Quite Excellent - It will grab even the most distant WiFi networks. 5 of 5 stars 7. Built In Apps. The email and other built in apps are flawless. 5 of 5 stars. 8. App Stores. I had no problem with Google Play or Amazon App Store running at the same time. 5 of 5 stars 9. Battery Life. The battery lasts all day for me and then some to spare. I usually have about 50% battery life after a full day of work. 10 of 5 stars! 10. Pulse Sensor, The S5 has some built in apps for health and a finger heartbeat sensor. It works ok, but its a little temperamental. 3 of 5 stars 11. Kit Kat Version. Its awesome! Lots of really cool embedded functions like looking at two apps at the same time on your screen. 5 of 5 stars 12. Built In Cameras. Holy Cow! Its the best I have ever used on a smart phone. 10 of 5 stars 13. Phone Microphone. The people say my calls are very clear, the clearest of any cell phone I have had ever! 5 of 5 stars. This phone is a quantum leap ahead of any other Android phone or device out there. It simply runs like the fastest computer you ever owned. I highly recommend this phone!",Mark,Samsung_S5,935
14 of 20 people found the following review helpful,2,Buggy and terrible considering how long the S-series have been out,"on May 14, 2014","For most people this phone may be OK but not for me and probably other tech geeks: GOOD: Best build quality I have seen in a phone. Water resistant not waterproof but still very cool and it works. After it gets dropped in water pop the back off you will see places where water will collect you will want to dry these places off. Despite this the OEM seal on the back cover did a great job of keep water out of the vital components. Phone is very resistant to most drop damage compared to competition. Heat rate monitor is pretty neat and the screen is the best on any phone I have ever seen. BAD: Samsung tried to pack a lot of technology into this phone and a lot of it does not work well. Most if not all of the following problems are common just do a google search and you will see. Firstly, as with a lot of locked DROID phones this one (at least the ATT model) has a bloated user interface over KitKat. Just look at the free space on this phone vs others. I went from a nexus5 to this phone and the difference between OS/KITKAT fluidity was night and day. This phone is constantly locking up and hanging and at least once a day required me to remove the battery to do a hard restart. Even the boot graphics are glitchy...really samsung? When the phone is locked sometimes the screen will no come back on when you unlock it. The finger print lock requires you to stroke your finger at a very specific angle or it wont work. I had about only a 60% success rate after using it for about 2 weeks so I went back to a pin lock. Camera has a really hard time focusing on really close objects and constantly hangs while taking pics and switching between picture modes sometimes locking the phone up. KITKAT has limited the user's ability to write to an external SD card so forget about copying music to it and popping it in your media player wont be able to read the songs. A root could easily fix this and the other issues if one were willing to forgo their phone's warranty but guess what not only is the ATT boot loader locked but it is encrypted so forget about trying to root it for now. Such a shame too with a root I think this would be the best phone out there but no way to really tell if the phone hardware is buggy or the User Interface. Personally I would avoid this phone it is a classic example of what looks good spec wise on paper does not always translate into how good the device is. Very very buggy phone which is unacceptable given this is the 5th series in the samsung S line.","Kevin Jarboe ""Jarbohydrate""",Samsung_S5,936

4 of 6 people found the following review helpful,4,apple fan girl no more,"on June 7, 2014","The only smartphones I've had have been I phones (3,4, and 5). I loved how intuitive everything about the ios was and the stability of it. I was super nervous about switching, but it was time to upgrade and to be honest there hasn't been anything new and exciting about the iPhone in a while. My husband and I both made the leap. There's very little I don't like about this phone, and since there are plenty of technical reviews, I'll just tell you what I like vs don't like in comparison to the iPhone. The first thing that I noticed upon turning it on was the screen. My god the screen. It is so. .. crisp. The colors are amazingly bright and clear. It's really beautiful. Let's not forget the size. Looking at it on the store shelf, I didn't think it would be that much bigger than my iPhone. It is. I have rather small hands, so I can't really use it one handed like I did my iPhone. There's some sort of setting that's supposed to shrink it down, but I haven't messed with it. It's not that big of a deal to me. Next, the camera. The 16mp rear facing camera takes amazing pictures. I no longer feel bad about my son's moments being exclusively captured on a phone camera. It seems a little slower than the iPhone, but the quality is so much better it's worth it. Now, the front facing camera is another story. 2mp? ! Really? It's the age of selfies and I have a 2mp front facing camera. Pictures taken with it definitely leave something to be desired. Oh well. App selection is awesome, obviously. I did notice a free app on iPhone is like 2 dollars in the play store (genius scan). I also really like kid zone, as does my three year old. I can just hams him the phone and not worry about him getting into other stuff. I did have to download a visual voicemail app. This is such a convenient thing that I don't understand why a phone would not have it already. My husband and I both were displeased about it enough that we found the app and downloaded it separately. It being made out of plastic isn't a big deal to me. Are there really people walking around wit phones not in cases? The fingerprint scanner sucks. It hasn't recognized my fingerprint the first couple tries ever, so I don't use it. The heart rate monitor also seems superfluous. The os takes a little getting used to. Mainly because there's just so much more that you cam do. Most of the stuff you'll be using on a day to day basis is easy. Oh and swype? Yeah it is fantastic. The phone is just so much faster than the iPhone. Now...I have had to restart it a couple times to get it to stop acting wonky. That was one of the biggest reasons I stuck with iPhone foe so long; none of this stupid turn it off and on again bs. Hopefully it doesn't become a regular thing. Overall there's much more I like about the phone than dislike. Apple would needed to do something drastic to get me back and I really just don't forsee that happening!",Nicole D,Samsung_S5,943

Big beautiful screen - The color and sharpness are amazing. I keep the brightness turned way down which probably helps the battery life. Speed - This thing is fast!! KitKat - Wonderful improvement over Jelly Bean. Everything just works and integrates well. Fingerprint scanner - Provides a reasonable amount of security with ease of use. It has worked well for me. Cons: Size and Weight - this phone is large and heavier but this is a reasonable trade off for increased screen size and battery life. Samsung apps - Turned almost all of them off.

One of the most cohesive experiences to date I've had on Samsung/Android products (have/had a Note 8.0, an S2 Skyrocket and have used some of the other tabs they provide). Still not without its glitches, but it seems they're ever closer to approaching the seemless experience I've had on Apple products. That may sound like a dig, but its not. Apple may be seemlesss, but they're also very limiting in my opinion. That said, there is also a bunch of what I'd consider, useless Samsung apps that come with it. They're easy enough to ignore/disable/uninstall. It feels like Samsung is trying to build its own version of a lot of the various cloud services that frankly, a lot of other companies do better.

I have practically everything turned off that sucks energy and still need to plug it into the charger every four or five hours with minimal use. It turns on easily in my purse, using up valuable battery time if I'm not watchful. The little plug cover that is supposed to help it be water-resistant came off within two months of my using it (and flipped into a sewer vent, so no hope of recovery).

I charged my phone and turned on the ultra-power-saving mode, because if the storm hit, I would not know how long I would be without power. I was lucky that the storm changed course and went south of my location. I did not lose power, but there are areas that have been without power for 12 days.

0 of 1 people found the following review helpful,2,Usability Should Be Better!,"on November 27, 2014","I agree 100% with the reviewer Kevin Jarboe. I have experienced many of the same issues. Been using Samsung Galaxy S Series for a few years (S, S3, S4 and S5 now). I usually love Samsung phones but I am very disappointed with the S5. It is the worst user experience I have had with this series of phones. I was excited about the S Health App and used it religiously. However, Samsung forced updates often that caused the app not to work anymore or loss of health data I took extra time to record everyday. This happened at least 3x so I finally removed the app. Sad because this was my favorite app and also one of Samsung's selling points. There are way too many taps required to get to the options or page destination you need. Example: While listening to music, I turn up volume, the phone stops 1/2 way up with a notification 'listening to music at a high volume can damage hearing..blah blah' then you must tap continue before the volume will crank up any higher. I don't like to be disrupted when I am enjoying my music. There is no option given to NOT show that message anymore so this happens everytime. Another example: Texting or browsing websites, if you receive a link via text from someone in your contacts, then tap the link to open, a msg displays with about 5 options, then you select, then a warning msg displays, then you tap continue, then the option of what browser to use displays, select and finally your page shows up. WTF!?! That is 4 taps just to view a web page sent from a friend via text. Why not just use my default browser, let the system autoread whether msg is from my contacts and eliminate the question of whether I want to open this link. This should be more user friendly as the previous versions were. Many of my photos are blurry due to camera having issues focusing. I could go on but I think the reviewer I mentioned above nailed it. These issues annoy me so much that I am thinking of switching over to iPhone. Never used one but I would try it due to the bugs and ridiculous changes with the Galaxy S5 at the moment.",KF,Samsung_S5,984
0 of 1 people found the following review helpful,2,Not Impressed,"on November 25, 2014","Overall, this is just an okay phone. I have been using iphones for the last 6 years and wanted to make a switch due to all the comments I've heard about how great Android was and the Galaxy phones offer more features. However, after purchasing this phone, I decided to return it. Here are my highlights: PROS: - S Health: Works great. The heart rate monitor works most of the time but you have to be still and in a quite area - Fingerprint Scanner: I read a lot of reviews about people knocking the scanner and saying it doesn't work well. I haven't had this issue, it works great - Beautiful HD display - Expandable memory via SD Micro Card - Replaceable Battery - Tethering for Free (if you download the right app) - Customization: This is a big + with Android. Not happy with the keyboard? Change it. Not happy with the layout of your phone? Change it. There's a lot of room to modify and change your phone to make it unique. CONS: - Poor Battery life (it drains 1% of my battery every time I play a 3-4 min clip on youtube). I've read tons of articles on tips and tricks to improve your battery life and nothing has helped. I possibly could have a bad battery. - No visual voicemail: Yes, you can download apps on their Google Play Store that support visual voicemail, however the quality of the visual voicemail is not as good as the iphone - Sound: The speaker on the phone isn't all that clear. Also when you put the phone on speaker, the phone itself feels like it vibrates based because of the sound, it makes the phone feel cheap even though I very much like the design of this phone. Furthermore, call quality is just so-so. Again I felt my old iphone 5 was more clear when making calls - Camera: When used outside, the pictures look good, however, when taking pictures inside the house or low light settings, this camera is very bad. I was shocked to see that the iphone 5 had much better picture quality and color tone. I can't help but make comparisons between the phones I've had in the past few years and this one I recently purchased. The Galaxy may offer 50+ more features than the iphone due to customization, however it appears that things that iphone can do, they do extremely well and is of high quality.",Foosball Master,Samsung_S5,985

Today I noticed a black ring that came loose under the glass that is covering the front facing camera. I called Samsung who told me that I would have to send it to them and be without a phone for 2+ weeks and that they do not provide a loaner or replacement phone to use in the interim. They wanted me to get one from my carrier, however I use a prepaid carrier and bought the phone on amazon and therefore could not get a loaner through those means. I explained this to them and told them it was a problem with a Samsung device, not my carrier or Amazon, but Samsung still refused to be of any help despite talking to multiple people. Searching for this issue online reveals that it is not an uncommon problem with this phone. It is very frustrating that Samsung will not take care of their customers despite the fact that it was a manufacturing/design error. Luckily Amazon customer service came through for me and has been very helpful. 5 stars for Amazon customer service. 0 stars for Samsung customer service, and 1 star for the Samsung Galaxy S5.",Michael Rogers,Samsung_S5,998

Aside from android being absurdly terrible as an operating system Samsung decides to go in and add its little ""tweaks"" resulting in constant force closes, 15 second camera boot up time (wtf?!) and non stop issues with email setup and MMS issues. I'm no newbie with software and hardware but it seems that both cell phone manufacturers and software companies are going backwards. Just to sum up my observations: Pros: nice screen, water resistant, long battery life. Cons: cheap feel, poor fingerprint scanner (does not catch finger print 50% of the time), absolutely horrible os (it is android so no surprise there), force closes in apps several times a day, camera takes no joke 15 seconds to load when you try to open it... I ""upgraded"" from the iPhone 5S a few months back because of the ridiculous screen size on the iPhone waiting for the iPhone 6 to arrive so this was an interim phone.

They sync up to our cordless phone base, to our car audio perfectly. Each time I walked back home, phone in my pocket synced up with cordless phone. Each time I sit in the car and started, it will sync up with the car. After switched to this new Galaxy S5, it does not sync most the time. I have to manually go to setup ->Bluetooth, then scan to get it sync up. Very frustrating. Called Verizon many times, they said the problem is Samsung. Write email to Samsung, got no reply. Recently, we also install a wechat app. That is even worse. We have to power off and power on the phone each day to get the app working. Same app works perfectly in other brand of phones. Without firmware fix, there is nothing Verizon can do for fixing these problems. We were told by Verizon. The brand new phone also showing hardware revision 0.5.

3 of 8 people found the following review helpful,2,Diamond in the rough? Nope.,"on July 18, 2014","So, here's an honest review; I don't know if I got a bad unit or not, but I didn't care enough to have it replaced; I just sold it at a loss. Let's get the obvious out of the way; the design and materials on this thing are terrible. The camera bulges out, and if you don't put this sucker in a case, you are going to scratch up the glass. The whole unit looks like it was designed by fisher price; perhaps I'm a bit spoiled, coming from an iPhone, but c'mon, even that fake metal ring around the phone looks cheap. The flap for the charger takes some getting used to; start growing long nails! But if you are willing to overlook the design, the real kicker is the touchwiz monstrosity that is preload on this phone. If you are used to a consistent user experience, well, it got up and left the building, and brought all his friends with it. Colors, circles, squares, ripples, oh my! I have a pity on a fool that opens up the settings menu! Endless sea of circle icons! This is the most complex UI I've ever used! But on the other hand, one might say, it has the horsepower to chew through all those layers of gummy bear UI, right? Wrong! Touchwiz stutters, lags, and sometimes crashes and restarts; watching Netflix heats up the phone enough for you to cook eggs on! That brings me to another topic; battery life. I can't relate to any of the glowing reviews on here about battery life, but the battery life on this thing lasts for 8 hours; on stand by. Yeah, there are no rouge processes running in the background, the signal strength is OK, and yet, by 3pm, I have about 30% battery left, and when I get home, the phone is dead. I'm now tied to a charger everywhere I go; I have one at home, at work, and 2 in the car, just in case I get stranded somewhere and one of the chargers breaks. Also, the unit does have some physical defects, the front facing camera wasn't seated properly, and there is a small piece of plastic covering the top portion of it. Whenever I try to do a Skype or the likes, the other person enjoys the view of my neck. I would assume this is a defect or a phone for ugly people; I don't know! The device also fails at basic phone functionality too; whenever I receive a call, sometimes the screen would remain dark. I would wait 1 ring, 2 rings, 3 rings, I would tap the screen a couple of times, shake the device in a voodoo fashion, hit the power button, and then eventually the screen would turn on, and inform me that I missed the call. Hmm... One would think that these reasons are enough to avoid this device at all costs, but it's not over yet. Bluetooth stack on this thing was probably written by a 6 year old; it doesn't work! It's Snap, Crackle and Pop all the way to the magic forest, with occasional Bluetooth crash here and there. At first I though it was incompatibility, but then I realized, it's the same with any Bluetooth device. It made Bluetooth audio useless with this device! I couldn’t list to music in the car, in the house; my only other option was to run an audio wire, circa 1970’s. The speakerphone is on the back of the phone and is tinny; crank it up during a conference call, and it starts to crackle. But it’s not all gloom and doom; perhaps a device can be forgiven for all its innumerable flaws, once you gaze upon the gorgeous AMOLED screen! It is truly a sight to see, no doubt about it. This is perhaps, the only advantage that this phone has going for it; this, and the camera. It does take good-looking shots, whether indoors or out, so you aren’t going to be disappointed by the pictures you take. Overall, it’s hard to recommend this device over something like an iPhone, or an HTC One; heck even Xperia Z2 is eons ahead of Samsung! If it weren’t for that screen, this phone would have flopped!","Iago ""trinity""",Samsung_S5,1011

Sometimes it doesn't recognize your finger on the first try, but almost always does on the second try. To increase probability of having my thumb recognized, I programmed 2 of the 3 fingers to be the thumb. That's all fine and dandy, but why is there a limit of only 3 fingers? Samsung also should have allowed different profiles based on which finger was swyped. But even that's not the biggest problem. My biggest gripe of all is that the fingerprint scanner cannot be used as the method of authentication for the Encrypt Device feature. I don't want to type in a long/strong password every time!! Are they really SSOOO inconfident about the security of the scanner?? We should be able to use the fingerprint scanner and a strong password as an alternative.","Matt ""Custom""",Samsung_S5,1015

I am not really much of a phone expert but you don't have to be to know that this is a piece of junk. AT&T tech said they oversold the phones and can not support them in my area unless they put up more towers. I purchased a Micro Cell Booster but that did not work either. This improved the number of bars but everyone still complained. Even AT&T's techs could not call me on my phone. They called me on my iPhone so they could hear me. My messages were still going to voice mail and then I only received them 2-3 days later. This did not just occur in my area so their other response of too many trees blocking the tower was just another ridiculous excuse. I had the Samsung Note.

47 of 56 people found the following review helpful,4,The Galaxy Series is finally Getting there (Sprint Edition),"on May 3, 2014","Ok, First off, I had to get my phone through Sprint, since they only offer the ""Easy Pay"" plan online or in store... (I would go with an Amazon Easy pay in about 2 seconds of it existed.) **Update 5/9 - I had my first experience of the IP67 Waterproofing Yesterday... I was working in my yard and had my phone in my shirt pocket, while up about 4 feet in a ladder my phone slipped out and dropped straight into a bucket of water! Honestly despite the certification I thought my phone was toast... But Nope, it didn't miss a beat, it was still working and playing Pandora without a problem. I was worried so I took off the case and back cover and found no water penetration into the phone, (The phone was submerged for about a minute) This was very satisfying to see and definitely increased my happiness with the phone....** Also this review won't go into Tech specs or Vs the major competition, Specs have been covered and ""Vs the competition"" is pretty subjective.. I owned an S4 so I'll compare it to that. Size: no major difference, it has decent hand feel, no it doesn't have a metal case and it isn't perfect but it works for me just as well or better than the S4. OS: I haven't rooted it yet or replaced the OS. The stock touchwiz seems to do fine in normal operating mode (It does stutter a bit in heavy power saver mode) Battery: It performs as well as my S4, and on most days a bit better... I used to get 8 hours even before I got the 15% battery warning, Now I go between 8 and 11 depending on use. Screen: It is significantly easier to see in sunlight than the S4. It does seems like it gets brighter... Samsung Features: Air Gesture and Smart Stay seem to work well. At least I should say better than the S4. I still have trouble with smart stay as I wear glasses, but it does seem better. The heart-rate monitor is a neat feature, and works well, but not something that influenced my decision. The Fingerprint scanner works better than the one on my work PC, but it is still more of a hassle (IMHO) than just punching a code or swiping a pastern. If I could just press my finger tot he screen and it would unlock then it might beat out the other lock methods for me. So in general I think it's a decent upgrade from the S4, but nothing that can't wait a year until the ""S6"" in 2015. (Except the inclusion of Tri-Band LTE which the S4 doesn't have). That all said if you have a sprint S4 and your LTE signal is good, you are safe to stay, but if you are on an S3 I would recommend the upgrade. It does do wireless charging either with an adapter or with the ""Charging Cover"" just like the S4, and I can't see any difference in the speed of charging between the S4 and S5... One caveat I found: The Tri-Band LTE no longer allows SVLTE (Simultaneous Voice and LTE Data) This means like AT&T you can no longer use data while you are talking on the phone (While on the network, Wifi still allows it)... So no checking a website while talking is out) Overall I give the S5 4 Stars: 5 Stars to start with. -1 Star for no SVLTE -.5 Star for Fingerprint Scanner Quirkiness -.5 Star for Plastic Design again +1 Star for Smoothing out Touchwiz Android Skin So 4 Stars overall, It's getting close to what I want a phone to be, but falls just short. It has replaced my S4 and I won't be switching back, but I Really hope the ""S6"" Addresses some more of the design quirks and brings battery life up significantly Just my thoughts, AK","Amadeus B.

I just got this phone 2 days ago and I will return it. 1st: this phone is not VOLTE which means you CAN NOT use the data while you are in a phone call. That's because Sprint use the one antenna for calls and data, so when you are call someone the data is turn off. 2nd: since I updated my firmware to android 4.4.4 my phone is getting terrible reception, showing one bar the majority of the time (Lame) . I tested the S5 against my Note 3 and it was mind blowing the Note 3 was on 4g LTE 80% of the time while the S5 was in and out of 3g the whole time didn't connect to 4g at all. 3er: The speakers sounds distorted when you turn the volume up. Coming from the S4 to the S5 i feel like i downgraded. I will keep using it for 3 more days before o return it. The reason why they are selling it so cheap is because they have warehouses fill with this phone and they have to get rid of them before the new Samsung Galaxy comes out on February. Im really disappointed I knew between the S4 and S5 weren't much different but I didn't know I was gonna take a step backwards. I've done my research and found out that At&t and Verizon S5s do support VOLTE. Sprint have the capability to do it but they aren't allowing us to use it. For more info Google Samsung S5 Cnet review. If you want a phone that wont have to worry about for the next two years get the Note 4. The Note 4 have been voted by most phone critics out there the best phone out right now. it has better screen than the S5, better Battery plus it comes with latest Android Lillipop installed. I returned my S5 and got a Note edge.",lenny peralta,Samsung_S5,1031
19 of 25 people found the following review helpful,5,The first time in years I've been absolutely stoked on a new phone; Samsung's best Galaxy,"on April 28, 2014","So, being a relatively practical smartphone guy who admittedly doesn't explore the world of apps or features nearly enough - the most important things first: (Sprint PCS 16gb Black Model, Phoenix Area) **upgrading from an HTC One** 1. The mobile data, which previously was erratic 4g coverage in my house/neighborhood or 3g only, has gone from averaging 1-2mbps to 7-12mpbs. There are about 4-5 spots in my house that I use when running SpeedTest on any device, and the S5 kills it. I've had the HTC One and the Galaxy Note II/S3 over the last 3-4 years and they all seemed to struggle with the data network in my actual home or surrounding area....2mbps on Sprint was the best I usually got. 2. The size and the casing of the phone finally feel ""right' - imho, the S3 felt a bit too cheap and the Note II was a bit gigantic. The screen size, whatever it is, is exactly in what I consider the sweet spot (and looks incredible). It's not made of metal or the heavy material that I associate with iPhones, but it feels durable in all the right areas. 3. If I end up being wrong about this, I'll update the review, but it appears to not have nearly as much pre-loaded garbage apps or bloatware as some of the earlier Samsung models. Out of the box it's lightning quick, and after about 5 minutes it was customized to my liking with all layouts/widgets/apps/feeds in their proper place and all security features configured and ready to go. 4. Keyboard input is noticeably better than other phones I've used lately. The default layout has a Swype-like feature on it, but also is surprisingly accurate when typing on the standard qwerty layout as well. Swype's keyboard was on the phone when I first checked, so either Google synced it up immediately or it was standard on the phone (I suspect the latter, as my account wasn't linked to it....gotta re-enter all of my dirty words). There seems to be a lot more to this phone and the OS is inviting enough that I may finally cave and start dinking around with apps and sHealth and all of the Web 2.3 (or are we at 2.4 yet?) toys my friends are obsessed with. But regardless, I can sum up how I feel about this phone with two sentences and the TL;DR: TL;DR - if you're used to Galaxy phones and like Samsung's previous models, consider this to be their best without question. All of the small upgrades seem to work as expected and have a clear purpose, and the Sprint network itself has massively improved functionality on this model (vs. the HTC One or Galaxy Note II).",NotSteveB,Samsung_S5,1032
4 of 4 people found the following review helpful,5,Excellent phone.,"on June 22, 2014","Its thinner than I expected, which makes it light enough that holding it up to your ear isn't an annoyance. The textured back makes it easier to hold on to, so you don't drop it. The sound quality on a call is great, and its pretty good listening to music too. It came with a pair of headphones with a mic that also work really well for calls or music. The phone is plenty powerful, applications are quick to respond, and the recent apps button that replaces the menu button lets you swap between recently used apps, and it happens so fast, it almost feels like multi-tasking. Its really an amazing phone. My only complaint, was very minor, in that I couldn't find the sd card slot. It is right on top of the sim card slot, which makes it easy to miss. There is an icon indicating you can put an sd card there, but before I looked it up online, I didn't even notice the icon. Not really enough to deduct a star.",Keaton,Samsung_S5,1033
3 of 3 people found the following review helpful,5,Most advanced phone I ever own so far.,"on October 20, 2014","I was eyeing this phone since it 1st came out. I've had it now for about a month and I had decided it was time to upgrade from my still working Epic 4G(S1) phone. I really like the waterproof feature as I have killed a couple of phones in the past to water damage. My old Epic suffered minor water damage on a few occasions but always seemed to work again in the end. Samsung made a well sturdy phone with a lot of features. This phone is guaranteed to stay working even if you were to drop it in the sink as long as you have the back cover and charging port cover tightly closed. With the quad core cpu I do more now in less time with fewer reboots or lock-ups. Keep in mind it has a fm radio, fingerprint scanner for screen unlocking as well as so many other features as I'm still learning it. There is no paper manual but you can download it from the web. This is also a sim card phone, and if I understand sim phones, this one can be used with any carrier just by swapping the sim card. There is no sdcard installed but it will take a 128gb sdcard, I took the 16gb out of my Epic so I would have the extra space until I am able to get a bigger card. If you used foxfi or pdanet for a hotspot program like I did in my Epic, this phone will only work in Bluetooth and usb modes (wireless tested but no connect) but it will give you 4G-LTE speeds, which is faster than dsl, but about half as fast as cable. Highly recommended for those wishing to upgrade to the best that money can buy. Make sure you pair this with a good case and I recommend a tempered glass type screen protector as well.",Philip J.

Actually a bit getting used to time is necessary; but understanding the phone and its operations is quite easy. Very sensitive and easy to use, fast working touch screen. Actually that division is vastly developed comparing to past models. Anyway the protection of touchscreen is very important.

2 of 2 people found the following review helpful,5,Amazing,"on August 29, 2014","Oh, Another year, another set of phones from manufacturers! I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. I will not call Samsung Galaxy S5 as revolutionary, but it is certainly evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. I love Samsung Galaxy S5 from its competitors for few reasons - removable battery, microSD card support and the maturity of the product. I have been using a S5 for past couple of days and have ordered a unlocked one from my local store. There are so many variants already in the market. So do check local specs. For example, in china market dual SIM S5 is available. Galaxy S5's back plate has a perforated dot pattern and a excellent matte finish. As a result, the phone looks far more sophisticated than its past designs despite its plastic build. Its surface feels nice to the touch without being too rough or too slippery. I really do _not_ care about the plastic, in fact the lightweight nature is what I care. Some people make a huge deal out of it. A high quality plastic is good for lightweight and I go with lightweight than a heavy phone in the pocket. A reputed tech site called recently Samsung as the “undisputed king of the Android smartphone space”. True indeed. With the plethora of devices in tablets/phones, they have iterated so much that they can produce truly stunning products. If you care for weight, the Galaxy S4 is lighter than S5. (please see my stats below). In fact pixel density is slightly higher in S4 due to a 0.1in size difference. So get an S4, it is cheaper and still same phone that came out last year. If you care for heart rate monitor, fingerprint scanner, and water proof, get the S5. Otherwise literally similar set and you can save a lot by getting S4 now. Last year when S4 came out it was a great phone. It still is, though S5 came out now. Obsoletion is in the mind of the us, not on the devices. In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice.

2 of 2 people found the following review helpful,2,"Are they making them too fast to quality check them, now? Or did I just get unlucky?","on August 27, 2014","Since receiving this phone, I get occasional blank screen. The lights will come on for the application selection and back back buttons, but the phone does nothing. Sometimes I can tap it just right (a gentle nod to the old days when smacking a TV would make it come back to life) but I do no more than a typical tap. Ultimately I end up either pulling out the battery and putting it back in which seems to work so far, or I have to try to do a hard restart by holding the power button in until it gives up, then turn it back on. With those seeming to work and the occasional tap, I must assume that the issue is an electronics connection on the motherboard or between the video card and display. Another, unrelated(?) issue is I will occasionally get an error message that either the SIM card or SD card are disconnected, but when I check it, it appears to be as snug as possible. I have been a huge fan of Samsung phones owning the Epic, S3, S4, S5 and even the Note 2014. I don't know if the supplier gets ""potentially unwanted"" batches and takes a gamble or if this is an issue I have so far been fortunate enough to avoid, but some research suggests I'm not alone. Some home remedies include resoldering the motherboard, but I don't want to risk warranty voiding. I was also told by a Sprint rep that phones not purchased directly from the store or website are not supported by the representatives in the store. So where do I go? I give it two stars because it has some really convenient features that I love using when it works, but then I get a phone call during ""Blank Screen"" and I sit there helpless wondering who called and if it is important.

Its really fast and well mad. Im not going to go all out on the specs in my reviews. I just want to hit on some key things I think some people would want to know. First thing i want to talk about is the heartbeat reader. i have tried to use it a few times at after my warm up at the gym. The app is pretty useful for the step counter.

Its a App and there alot of other one out there, im you find one that you like. Now H2O proof? No its not, but it is water resistant. So if it rainy outside or someone hand you it in the shower no worries. It will still work just fine. But DONT swim with it, It wont be the same and mostly like die on you later. But if you really really need to swim with your phone, there are ""some"" cases out there CLAME it will make it water proof. that's its 4/5 stars only because there's always room for improvement.

8 of 11 people found the following review helpful,5,Great Android Phone,"on April 23, 2014","I know I wont cover everything that this phone has, pro and con, so I will just explain what I've noticed. First off - the plastic. Seems like every review has a gripe with plastic as a material on this phone - Ive owned iphones (1,2,3,4s,5s), HTC's (one), and Galaxy's (SIII) - and I enjoy the feel of this phone. The back is dimpled soft, if youve seen or held a (Asus) Google Nexus 7 2012 the back is exactly the same, soft to the touch and provides great grip. The plastic sides may scratch, but honestly not as easy as a HTC with its brushed finish. When I first opened the box, I held the phone in one hand and the battery in another and couldn't figure out how, together, they would create a sufficient weight to 'feel' like a phone. You get used to it. I didn't like the riveted bezel in pictures, and while its grown on me, I still don't think aesthetically it was the best choice. The phone is IP67 which means dust and waterproof, something I have yet to voluntarily test. After a few minutes the phone felt just like it should in my hand. I can operate almost all features with one hand (6'1"" / normal hands). The S5 is truly a slab of a phone, thin with an exquisite screen. The screen pops with color and is hypnotizing when you throw a good image or video on there. The camera is great, though I would highly recommend the Google official camera in the play store. The stock Samsung camera is good, but has so many options and settings a nerd like me gets too lost in technical aspects. Google camera uses the Samsung's 16 megapixel sensor beautifully - the panorama and photo-sphere modes blew everyone away at the beach. No matter the camera app you use, low light is a large problem for this sensor, and it shows in most pictures I've taken inside. The video is 4k, though I've read its not technically 4k playback, fact is, I don't have a 4k TV so it doesn't matter. The video looks good on my 23"" monitors and that's good enough.The s-health app is pretty much useless with its heart rate sensor constantly unable to measure or reporting vastly different readings, and the pedometer was different than a few other fitness wearable I've compared. Touchwiz is less bloated, but since I've used Cynogenmod 10.2 on my SIII and stock Android on my HTC I still see allot of unneeded stuff there. The reason I haven't tried to flash this S5 yet is that some of the features really are cool, like power saving mode, right now with my S5 @ 88% it estimates 11.0 days of standby time in 'Ultra Power Saving' mode. This may come in handy soon, because the screen (as gorgeous as it is) hogs the battery. Right now its using 32% of my systems battery resources and its set to about 45% brightness. The Touchwiz over Android KitKat is snappy as hell, only lag I get is with my Google Voice integration stuttering when I open the Google Voice app to text. One other thing that is trivial but worth a mention is that the USB 3.0 charger is bulky and tough to attach to your phone, you first pull off the sealed port on the S5 (b/c of waterproof) that is held on with a small piece of plastic, and to get the USB male end into the port, youve got to be firm. It does charge fast, about 2 hours to full charge from 3% for me so far. I think that the Samsung Galaxy line is truly a workhorse of a phone, and plan on having this for at least a few years.","KBT3k ""kbt3000""",Samsung_S5,1045

The Bluetooth connected easily to the Microsoft Sync in my car, though it's not compatible with the text feature (2010 model basic ford sync) - this was true with my s2 as well. Features I like have more to do with software upgrades such as the widget allowing you to track your data usage with the option to warn you of reaching your limit (if you have a limited data plan). Similarly, it tells you which apps are using the most data allowing you to adjust your usage. Automatic back ups to the cloud only kick on with wireless connections (smart). Oh, and it's FAST! Set up with my work email accounts on Microsoft exchange servers was a breeze compared to past phones too.

I've recommended ordering it from Amazon to many of my friends and family that use Sprint. Ordering through Amazon: Worked seamlessly through my existing Sprint account. It sucked up one of my upgrades from our plan, and I got a disgustingly good deal on the newest generation of phone. A big thank you Amazon for being awesome and offering us such a good deal. The phone itself: Overall: It does all the normal 'phoney' things. So that's nice. Size: It is big, which makes it slightly cumbersome to handle with one hand. But for me, the extra screen size is worth it. Signal: For some reason my signal bar is typically lingering at 1 or 2 bars. This would normally concern me and make me give the ""signal strength"" a bad review. But wherever I go, I can still access the web/data and make phone calls like normal. So that's strange and seemingly concerning, but it doesn't end up effecting me... so I'm a little torn on that one. Features I actually use: *I use the finger print scanner to unlock my phone. So great! *I put a message on the lock screen that has a note with my friends phone number on it. Now if someone finds my lost phone, they'll have a way to return it to me. *I organize all my apps into folders from the home page. And put those fancy stock ticker widgets and weather widgets on the second page. *All the standard smart phone stuff, phone calls, pictures, texting, taking pictures, making videos. *I actually edited a video earlier with an app in there. Someone in the background called someone else fat during the video, so before I could upload it to facebook I had to crop out that section of the video, then merge two videos together. It processed all that pretty well and wasn't painfully laggy.",Serisno,Samsung_S5,1053

Read others for tech details, but be aware of this happy fact: it comes GSM enabled. Slip out the SIM card, slide in a GSM card and it is ready to play internationally (as long as you have an international plan in place). Bought as gift for family member who just returned from England. Wish we had bought it a year ago before the study-abroad year! Powerful processor provides lightning-fast downloads and uploads. Display is crisp, bright, and BIG. On-screen keyboard is larger than most and enables fewer input errors. Thin profile. Battery holds up well, considering the robust processing speed and large display. Practically plug and play. Activation was nearly hands-free, requiring only two response clicks. Excellent delivery time and value. Looking forward to a lot of fun with this phone. At time of purchase, this model was 50% of the price at the carrier's store, and came GSM equipped. If you had doubts about ordering your next mobile this way, dispel all worries and dive in. The experience has been completely positive, loads better than dealing with a salesperson face-to-face in a brick-and-mortar store.","S. Edwards ""traveller512""",Samsung_S5,1054

First off, it's not as user friendly as the IPhone. Secondly it's so big that it's like trying to eat a slice of pizza by holding the entire pizza in your hand. Thirdly it doesn't have all the apps for the new operating system that I really used a lot It does have some plus's though. The battery lasts so long that you swear that it will never run out and when you go to the ultra power savings mode it lasts even longer This thing will not drop a call, I think I could make a call from under my house and it would not drop it If you have enough light to see the camera will take a picture in low light areas that will amaze you. I hope that if you are buying this expecting to get a better product than you had before (especially if you are an apple person) you will look at what you use that is easy on your phone and see if you want to mess with it on the android phone.

It appears that the S5 has network issues that Sprint ""may"" be working on. Where I had half to full bars on the S3, I now frequently have none. I did some online research and found that this is not an uncommon problem. I did find one post on a tech blog that had a suggestion from Sprint Customer Care regarding changing the Network Connection. That appeared to have had some positive impact initially, but one to two bars is still the norm. Aside from this issue, the phone is great! Navigation is very intuitive and the larger screen is wonderful. Hopefully Sprint can resolve the issue with the network.

Input is too large for some reason so headphones don't work. Have to return to Amazon and nothing can be done in the Sprint store so now I'm out of a phone for a few days since I already traded in my old phone. Wouldn't recommend buying off of Amazon since Sprint won't help you if something goes wrong or you recieve a defected phone. Not sure what type of phones Amazon is supplying, could be refurbished, especially since it was much cheaper than everywhere else. Although it was a huge inconvenience to go without a phone and send it back, Amazon's customer service was great and overnighted my new phone once I sent the defected one back.

2 of 3 people found the following review helpful,5,Best Cellphone Ever,"on November 26, 2014","Upgraded to this from galaxy S3, so many improvements. I'm an extreme critique when it comes to everything, and this phone has minimum downsides. First off, I was tired of paying Sprint for phone insurance, because they wouldn't fix my S3 when it was obviously bugged and broken, even though I paid $11/month for a year and a half. That being said, I wanted to save $11 a month which adds up fast. Well luckily this phone is water resistant and known for being very strong. So I took a chance and bought this, never paid for insurance, and never will. Finally engineers had more influence than businessmen. Along with a Spigen case, this phone works perfectly after many big drops, spills, and even swimming with it. This is a big deal for anyone on a budget as you can save a lot by not buying insurance, where you might need it for other phones. Note it's not water proof so don't have it underwater for long periods of time, and take any case off after. As I left mine on, which trapped water underneath case, and phone glitched out for a few days, but returned to normal. The battery life is amazing, better than any phone I've ever seen or used. I know there are a few others recent phones with similar quality battery life, but the extreme power saver mode which I use if I'm near out of battery and don't have charger is extremely useful. Plus with the usb 3.0 charger, it's charges EXTREMELY fast, 20 minutes will get you a substantial charge. This also is nice for transferring pictures/movies to/from phone to computer. As an audiophile, the audio drivers are great and provide amazing sound to my high end earphones. The included equalizer has a simple mode and advanced mode which both work nice. It's nice not to need an additional app for that. Literally the only downside to this phone that I can think of is that the ""drop down menu"" does not include a mobile data toggle button. Which is extremely retarded of the software developers (May be an operating system flaw). Because along with Wi-Fi and location (gps) it is one of the few buttons I would use. I used a third party app to make a homescreen widget to do this, but why not include it in drop down menu like my old phone? After my S3 which I found a little big for my liking, the S5 which is even bigger doesn't annoy me size wise, it seems just right. If desired you can even shrink the screen for ""one-hand"" use. Conclusion: Get this phone, you won't be disappointed. - Sorry for long review, May it be helpful.","Brian D. Westerhof ""OutOfChillPillz""",Samsung_S5,1071
,5,Great Phone with a few overlookable flaws,"on July 15, 2014","Love this thing! The screen is absolutely spectacular. The colors are brilliantly amazing and clear. Watching videos on this thing is by far the best mobile video viewing experience I've had. I had an iPhone before and don't think i'll be going back. I love how this device allows you, with many different platforms, to intergrate everything you do; from your packages being delivered, calenders, S Health, Google Pictures, GMail, the list goes on. The one downside is the bluetooth module they put into their ""flagship"" phone is pretty weak. Considering it's Samsungs flagship device, I would've expected stellar specs across the board but the bluetooth is a bit lackluster. Another problem I have with it is that I have set all the apps and pretty much all my data as limited to Wifi only, but for some reason, the only time I get notified for updates is when I leave wifi. As much as I am over Apple and iTunes, I gotta hand it to them. The OS we beautifully simple and bug free. Unlike Samsung Andriod.",cBeb,Samsung_S5,1072

2 of 3 people found the following review helpful,4,"It's nice, but some may question that","on June 12, 2014","Upgrading from a HTC EVO I was blown away by the options this phone has. Sadly Sprint's hit-and-miss cell coverage in various parts of Metro Phoenix, AZ leads me to deduct one star. I ultimately went to the GS4, as the cost for a new phone was $0.01 on Amazon, and as of the date of this review Sprint has an option to use Wifi calling; allowing the phone to text and call anytime with no restrictions if placed to domestic numbers. I did have problems with the Samsung fit application, it kept resetting causing the memory to delete. Also the pedometer was a tad bit sensitive as the steps would creep up as I had the phone sitting on the console of my car. I can't find anything wrong with this model except to say a fool like myself would break the screen quickly, thus I bought an Otterbox Defender Series to prevent my neanderthalish ways of causing damage to the phone; specifically the large screen.",Past_DVO_Present,Samsung_S5,1076

There is a feature called daydream, when you charge your phone u can pick a screen saver basically, that only worked the first two charges. My phone stays on, even when on the charger. It does not even go into the lock screen mode and I don’t have any feature on for the phone to always be on. The phone does my vibrate when a text message comes in if it is on vibrate. I had to go in the settings to put the messages on vibrate, which ALWAYS vibrate even when my phone is on sound. This is annoying to me. Still no flash player. I really like the camera. Can’t believe they got rid of the menu button. From time to time my settings just disappear. I still hav eto charge my phone EVERYDAY!

If you want that capability (who in their right mind wants to submerge a phone?) Then you need to s5 active.

Pretty good reception compared to other sprint phones we've had. I've been happy with the battery life and it charges quickly. I've been able to take some super nice photos with the camera. fingerprint sensor always works (except when wet). I could care less about the health apps + heartbeat sensor. I only really used a few of the 'app extras' that samsung bundled in, most are like a few months free premium access and then they want you to pay for continued use. Waterproof is great - i've had people asking what phone this is, i took it to hawaii and submerged it in hot tubs and the ocean, took video underwater of fish with it. The controls are difficult or not really able to be used under water. The headphone jack did get some gravel in it + was hard to clean, and while it was drying out it kept giving me the headphone notification which was annoying. I'm not giving it a 5 star because the phone still lags at times, probably samsung's software and other apps causing it, and the chrome band around it nicks pretty easily - they could have used tougher plastic for that. You should probably still get a screen protector or cas... somehow i managed to get a decent scratch on the gorilla glass, and that would also help the dents on the rim.

0 of 1 people found the following review helpful,5,but this phone was still great for my son,"on November 11, 2014","Even though every S5 is physically the same, the Sprint S5 will be different from the other carriers. Verizon phones are often unlocked, at least in part since the S4 came out. In other words, if you put a T-mobile Sim card or AT&T sim card in a Verizon phone you can make a phone call. However, data speeds will vary. In may area service with others carriers is a little bit stronger than it is on Sprint, but this phone was still great for my son. All S5's are water resistant. 3 feet, 30 mins. I can be under water really longer than that, but I would not recommend it! The great thing about Samsung is that you can stop by a best buy on Mon, Thur or Saturday for free classes also!. For those not use to the newer version of Samsung there is also a lot of videos under Samsung Mobile on youtube. However, all the how to for the S5 and Tab Pro (Same button set up) is under SamsungmobileUK not samsung mobile US or sammobile. Oh, I have been all over the US with this phone and it works great. Also the samsung people can do a software update for you in about 10 mins in a best buy store versus waiting an 30 mins to an hour to download an update at home!

Problem is the Sprint network. You CANNOT use the phone (voice) with data (internet) at the same time. What does this mean? If you are using the GPS and you get a call the GPS will drop. IF you are on the phone and need to look at an email, you cant. If you want to look up something on the internet while talking on the phone you cant. This is finally the straw that broke this camels back.. I purchased this phone through best buy and then three days later took it back to BB and returned it. I have left Sprint and went to Verizon where you CAN talk and surf at the same time. Sprints says they will have this feature once they update to the Spark network but that it will take a while to reach all areas.. much like it did for 4g I have been with sprint for over 10 years now and they are always behind.

Upgrading from the Galaxy S3 to the S5 is a noticeable difference. The bigger size and options takes a minute to adjust to, but Samsung added some nice touches. I have only owned it since Oct.8th, so I don't have much to say about performance or issues i've noticed. The picture quality of the camera is my favorite aspect so far, though it is kind of frustrating when doing a ""selfie"".

The fingerprint scanner works better than I expected, and is reliable enough (when your hands arent covered in something) to use it to unlock the device. The fact that it is able to be used under water (in case you have a kid that likes to try to flush random things down the toilet) makes this an added bonus, not to mention it's very fast and responsive.

When I had the chance to upgrade I was read all the reviews and thought the S5 would be the best choice. I get the phone at BestBuy through Sprint service, paying the full price of the phone through their ""Easy Pay"" plan, and was at first happy with the speed, the functionality, and the features. Then I try to use the camera. A black spot in every picture. I look and under the camera glass is some particulate. Obviously something from the manufacturer since it's sealed under the glass. I contact Best Buy: Sorry, can't help you since it's been over 14 days. Go to the Sprint store. I go to the Sprint store in the mall: Sorry, can't help you here, you have go the OTHER Sprint store. The next day I go to the other Sprint store: Sorry, it's been 31 days so you have to contact the manufacturer. I contact the manufacturer by phone: We don't do replacements, you have to mail the phone to us at your cost, and we'll fix it and send it back to you. Leaving me without a phone for at least 4 weeks. I'll never get a phone from Sprint or Samsung again.",Charles,Samsung_S5,1246

It generally tells me that my ""connection is lost"" and I have to manually turn off the wifi to get the 4G to kick in. Additionally, as intrusive as Apple is into your device and personal life, Google is far, far worse. People complain that Apple is product centric and everything has to be Apple, Google is no different. I hate them both. If I had it to do over again I would have gone with the LG phone.","William J.

Sprint should be ashamed for releasing something so poorly planned. I switched from AT&T with my old Samsung Galaxy S (before they even had a number following it) which worked with voice and data at the same surprise. Imagine my surprise when I ""upgraded"" to the S5 and changed to Sprint. I had the newest and ""best"" phone available, but I couldn't talk and surf (UNLESS I WAS ON WIFI!!!!!!!). After discovering this problem and the fact that it probably won't be fixed for a couple of years, I cancelled while within my grace period and went back to AT&T...

7 of 19 people found the following review helpful,1,Glorified camera with calling features,"on May 25, 2014","Pros: Decent camera; great shots in daylight. Not so great in lower light. It does OK sending pictures, and once you find the picture file location, it's easy to grab and copy pictures. Removable battery. External memory extension slot. Cons: (so very many) Finger swipe security feature takes several swipes, and recent (May 2014) update will not lock the phone completely for 30 seconds after 5 swipes (Previously it force a password entry). Been trying for days to find a way to back up, but no go. Backups fail, restores fail, and doesn't sync well with outlook. Sync feature will lose data from phone to Outlook on a computer, particularly Contacts. Tasks are hidden within the calendar feature, making them all but useless. Backup will say ""complete"" but onlly phone log and alarm will actually back up. Samsung apps like S-Health will randomly erase all data, and apparently can't be downloaded. It takes several tries record a pulse (the sites will say, ""don't press too hard"" but I found I don't press hard enough). You're forced to sign up and share the data with Samsung, yet it keeps getting erased from my phone, and I can neither back it up nor restore it, despite having it set up to automatically back up every three hours. If you set up Picasa, you cannot delete pictures that have synced. Samsung's support is aggravatingly useless. The Kies software has options for synchronizing Tasks, but their support says it's not supported. Based on searching the Samsung site and other forums, along with using the Kies software, it's clear that the app isn't fully supported by Samsung itself, and they have no documentation at all, except basic ""how to."" If you try to get answers from them, they'll insist on getting carrier-specific model information because the phone is supposed different for each carrier. I have a hard time believing something so basic as Tasks is different. It will continually tell you the back cover is loose when it's clearly not. There are also multiple on=board apps for things; Samsung's brand, Google brand, and the amount of bloatware is insane. I regret buying this phone, and Samsung's responses to technical support requests have guaranteed I will not purchase another Samsung product again.","J. A. Brown ""J.A. Brown""",Samsung_S5,1259

AND IF FUALTY MERCHANDISE BREAKS, IT IS SAMSUNGS POLICY NOT TO REPLACE IT!","on September 6, 2014","If you want a phone that can break and when and when/if it does, there is no guarantee you can get it replaced, than this is the phone for you! I can talk about all the things on this phone that would be good features, but what does it matter if the phone is broken. What does it matter that the phone is supposed to be ""water resistant"" YOU CANNOT PUT THIS PHONE IN WATER!!!. If you close the phone properly and water still gets in, they will tell you that it was still your fault that it doesn't work. Because there in unfortunately and conveniently almost no way to prove that the phone stopped working due to faulty merchandise. I bought one of these and through my warranty plan replaced it for $200.00 when my first phone broke due to water damage. Then I got a second one, of which I had for about 3 days, before it broke too. that phone broke when I went swimming. I was in shallow water, and for a very short amount of time. I made sure that everything was closed securely on this phone before I went swimming due to previous experience. When this phone stopped working, I took it to a certified Samsung repair store. The phone failed the pressure test, proving that the faulty merchandise was in fact not ""water resistant at all"" they also said that the corrosion in the phone was irreparable. When I called corporate with these findings from their OWN store. They said it was not SAMSUNG POLICY to replace THEIR phones even the faulty ones. That replacement can ONLY be done through your phone service provider. EVEN THOUGH THE PHONE WAS ONLY IRREPAIRABLE BASED ON THEIR FAULTY MERCHANDISE TO BIGIN WITH! We tried going through our service provider to return this phone. They wanted us to give them another $200. We would not agree to this! We decided to cancel our service completely and go with another phone service. NO one wanted to give us a working phone, or our money back! They sent us a faulty phone and offered NO GARANTEE. This phone can and will sometimes break in water. IT IS NOT a WATERPROOF PHONE! They will not replace it should it become irreparable, EVEN IF IT IS THEIR FAULT!! Who wants to spends hundreds of dollars on any phone without any kind of guarantee the phone will work. IT IS SMASUNGS POLICY TO NOT STAND BY THEIR PRODUCTS. I am never buying anything Samsung again. AND not just because I am angry with how they ""resolved"" my issue. But also because I am concerned that I will have to deal with SAMSUNGS POOR POLICY and NO GARANTEES again!

Those who plan to purchase an unlocked phone and intend to use it inside US please be careful. Most S5 models came with LTE capability, but not all of them are compatible with the US provider. For example: G900A is specific for AT&T, 900T is for T-Mobile etc. Some of them are interchangeable but you need to be aware of the compatibility. For example, 900F model (this one) supports LTE 850 / 900 / 1900 / 2100 (these numbers are actually frequency like in the radio channel), but AT&T provide LTE using 700.

1 of 1 people found the following review helpful,5,Fantastic! - Vendor is Shopebest.,"on October 3, 2014","Brilliant! Came in the box. Has a nice sticker over the side that states ""Do not accept if seal is broken"" Inside the box is a shiny new S5 SM-900FD phone with all the plastic still in place. Under that is the SN and ID data sheet / sticker... (don't loose). Under that a quick start guide. Below that you find the Charger (Euro), cables, earbuds and a Euro to US plug adapter for the charger. But since its basically a USB adapter any USB Phone charger 'should' work fine (check the voltages though). Some people seem to have been confused by the Euro charger. Im guessing the term ""International"" didn't quite hit home for them. The screen is untouched, the back is untouched and apart from the addition of the US adapter its a perfectly fine almost straight from the factory box. Just make sure you check the UPC on the box ""Before"" you break the seal. My only quibble is the packaging.. No kind of bubble wrap or shock material at all. The package was snug around the box so it didn't ""bounce around"" in the box. But there was little in the way of shock absorbing materials. UPS delivered the package un molested though.",Adrian Swift,Samsung_S5,1334

,5,Great phone,"on September 8, 2014","The phone came in a sealed box and was definitely completely new. It was unlocked as expected, however branded to Vodacom (only noticable by the flash screen on startup). Not sure what that means for the warranty but I assume Samsung will honor their warranty no matter the original carrier. Since that is the only noticeable thing about it and it works fine with my SIM card, I don't care, but if it bothers someone, you'd have to root it to get rid of it. Another thing is that it came with an European charger and a cheap chinese adapter. I had some other Samsung chargers lying around, and bought it for Europe anyway, so I was happy about that. If you want to use it mainly in the US, you may want to get another Samsung charger. I used the phone in Dalvik for a while and noticed a significant improvement in speed after switching to ART. It turned hot briefly after the switch, but after that it ran smoothly and I had the feeling battery life improved also (although it was already great to begin with, it lasted 2+ days playing music, watching movies, using navigation plus mobile data and WIFI). I was at first worried that some apps would not run, but non of the apps had a problem, in fact, they almost uniformely ran better, except for the Kindle app which is incredibly slow for some reason and was from the beginning (did only try the Samsung version). Amazon music on the other hand runs perfectly. The design of the phone is beautiful, the colors of the screen are great and it is easily readable in bright sunlight. A joy to watch movies. I was also impressed with the sound quality of the included headphones. The camera makes great photos even in low light, and does not have the lag I had on my old phone. The front camera is gritty in low light, but that is to be expected. The fingerprint sensor works amazingly well. I have one on my HP laptop, and did expect the one on the phone would have the same problems with sweaty fingers, but it worked well even when I was biking. That said, it also works great as a phone ;). Overall, I'm very happy with this phone, and also with the seller. Delivery was speedy (arrived three days before the Amazon predicted date). I should mention that I got this phone from Top10Cell, since there are different sellers for this. As I said, Top10Cell was selling the African (Vodacom) model.",Molly,Samsung_S5,1363

2 of 3 people found the following review helpful,5,Works on T-Mobile U.S.A (in depth network/phone review),"on August 29, 2014","Works with T-Mobile U.S.A I live near Seattle WA, unfortunately there is no 4G or LTE connection that is establishable and I get 3G and a very good HSPA+ connection with average Download speed of 22mbps and upload of 7mbps on 3G. 29mbps download and 11 uplaod on HSPA+. I have a Galaxy S3 LTE (T999L) version for T-mobile as well and I get 35mbps download and 15 upload on T-moblies 4G LTE network.There is not a big gap at all between the different network speeds, call quality and text messaging is liquid smooth, no complaints there. If your a big network buff then this shouldn't be a huge deal because I also did some testing with my Galaxy S3 and this Galaxy S5 side by side and the speed difference is usually a 1-2 second delay. The place where 4G and LTE outperform is when downloading and uploading big files, not small files like updates from the playstore etc. My advise is not to buy this phone based on network, rather on the phone itself, it is a amazing device and I highly recommend it to friends. Don't let things like network speeds that load your webpages 1 second slower get in the way from the amazing user experience that the phone itself has to offer. If you really want a good stable connection then switch to WiFi this phone has a killer network connection to Wifi it's super fast and very stable, mobile networks too. So whoever may be reading this review this is a fantastic phone the best i've had the privilege of having it works on T-mobile U.S.A and there is no noticeable network difference from a pure T-mobile device. So if you want a Galaxy S5 then i highly recommend this one because if you don't live in the U.S. then you may have 4G LTE. I have no complaints at all hands down best phone out there. I hope this helped anybody, and helps with your purchasing decision.",Steven Richards,Samsung_S5,1373

This model is from the UK. We bought one and had a problem with the screen (vertical lines running through it). Samsung US won't fix it as they claim to use a different firmware load so we have to send it to the UK. Samsung UK won't accept it directly from the US (customs issues?) so we have to ship it to a friend in the UK ($35 each way for shipping and customs) who ships it to Samsung UK who repairs it under warranty who ships it back to our UK friend who ships it back to us. Once we get it back it will be a tough decision as to whether we keep it or sell it. UPDATE: We received the phone back from Samsung in the UK with a letter that reads: ""Thank you for sending your mobile phone to us. James, one of our engineers at our approved service centre, has tested your phone and they have found that it is not working because your handset has been found to be of non European origin. Samsung products are covered by a regional warranty and therefore only protected by the warranty specific to that region. Our records indicate that your handset (Samsung SM-G900F (GS5) 16GB white) was originally manufactured and shipped outside of Europe and is therefore not covered by the European warranty. We would recommend that you contact your supplier from where you had purchased your handset to discuss the matter further. Kind regards, Samsung Electronics UK. So, despite giving the UK service center my phone's model number, IMEI and serial number BEFORE I sent it on a lovely journey to the UK and back, they returned it and denied that it was of European origin. I have spent countless hours with Samsung UK and US and neither can help me figure out exactly who will fix this problem under warranty. I bought it from a private party who purchased it from Amazon so my next call will be to Amazon to see if they can somehow help me.",Baldy,Samsung_S5,1394

Apart from these three things the phone is fast, smart, easy to use, feel that you are connected to everything, everywhere, notifications are not intrusive, as are updates.

First it did not work out of the box, next the seller refused to take it back without restocking fee and me paying for return shipment. AT&T said that it was not unlocked properly and certainly not done by Samsung but was done (attempted) probably by the Seller after importing it into US (evidenced by the pins of the wall charger) which already voided the OEM warranty. So instead of incurring the restocking fee and return postage I took to a local guy who did the unlock but regardless he said this will not run on USA 4G network unless unlocked properly by Samsung.

400 of 410 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 23, 2015","I got a chance to test a Galaxy S6 out and immediately bought one for my wife. I'm a complete phone nerd (XDA Developers Recognized Contributor, if that means anything to you) so I massively over analyze these things. It's a VERY nice phone but it's got some things that I consider drawbacks. For my wife, all the drawbacks listed below were non issues. She didn't care about these issues. So understand that my 'drawbacks' are completely subjective to your personal needs. But they are things that you should be aware of and consider if they mean anything to you before purchasing. ?????THE UPSIDES????? ? The screen is incredible. Like really incredible. The resolution is better than my eye can see. I use a Galaxy S4 as my regular phone and it has great resolution where you can't see individual pixels. I thought the S4 screen was as good as you can get, but the S6 screen takes it to a whole new level. Even though you can't see pixels on either screen, the higher resolution of the S6 screen makes everything look so sharp that it's nearly impossible to tell you are looking at a screen. It's that incredible. ? The design of the phone just feels more 'expensive'. I mean that in a good way. It feels just higher quality than previous models in the Galaxy S line. The S3 and S4 for example are often critiqued for having a plastic shell. The S6 has a metal band around the outside that just makes it feel 'premium' in your hand. It should also provide more protection for the device as well. ? TouchWiz is HEAVILY scaled back. I hate TouchWiz (Samsung's version of Android) It adds a layer of UI that is neither helpful nor intuitive. And it's a resource hog which slows the phone down for important tasks just so it can make the scrolling smoother, and other such useless tradeoffs. On the S6 TouchWiz was barely noticeable. The UI looks more like the standard Google Android Lollipop interface. It was all just much smoother and simpler and better and wonderful. ? Camera. 16 MP. And the images it takes look stunning on the super HD screen. Those photos on a larger high resolution monitor are simply stunning. ?????THE DOWNSIDES????? ? The battery is not removable or easily replaceable. A cell phone battery has a life of about 500 charge cycles. I tend to keep my phones for 2 years as daily users, then I keep my old phones for a variety of other purposes around the house. (My old HTC Sensation is hooked up to my stereo for use as a nice wifi streaming media player with a touchscreen UI, for example) I eventually have a need to replace batteries because I wear them out. I like being able to go on Amazon, spent $20 on a replacement battery, pop it in and be done. Additionally, even if you don't keep your phones that long, batteries fail sometimes. The stock batteries on the Galaxy S4 had some problems. They were minimal, but for those affected the battery absolutely had to be replaced. On the S4 it took 8 seconds and the problem was solved. On the S6 I'm sure it would be covered by warranty but it'd be a pain to take it somewhere to have it worked on should the issue come up. So no replaceable battery is a deal killer for me. This might not be an issue for you. If not, great! But be aware of the issue before making purchase decisions. ? You can't expand the storage with an SD Card. I don't want to live in the cloud. I hate the cloud. Sometimes I'm not on an LTE network. Sometimes I'm in the middle of nowhere but still want to show someone pictures of my kids. I got my wife the 32GB model. That sounds like a lot, but keep in mind that some of that is dedicated for the operating system and user apps. So you don't get to use all 32GB. The S6 is going to be available in up to 128GB, which ends my problem with not liking the cloud option. Again, you might not care. If not, great! My wife doesn't keep a lot of stuff on her phone. She moves all her pictures to her computer and never loaded video to watch on her phone, so the storage thing wasn't a big deal to he",Obi Wan,Samsung_S6,1

21 of 23 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 12, 2015","the Galaxy s6 is the best phone that has released this year. Here's why: -screen resolution : Samsung has updated the screen resolution from full hd(1080p) to qhd (1440p or 2560*1440) so the screen now is much sharper than before. -finger scan : the finger scan is much improved over the previous model , now you only have to tap or hold the button like the iPhone 5s and 6/6+. Previously you have to swipe the button to get verified , a lot of time is wasted and uncomfortable doing this way assuming you're using it a lot . -battery life : the battery life is not much improved than the previous model , but it is enough to get you through the day . -the build: the build is now really a big update since the s4. It is now much thinner at 6.8mm thick and it has metal frame so it feel really good in the hand just like holding a premium phone as it is tend to be. It is also lighter from 145to 138 g due to its thickness , so you feel now more comfortable in the hand . -camera : the camera remains 16 megapixel like the previous model , but that doesn't mean it is like the previous model . Samsung has updated the sensors and pixel size so you can make better shots and better 4k video!! The processor : the processor is also updated with Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2.1 GHz Cortex-A57, but this wasn't much of a problem as the previous model already ran pretty fast The sacrifices& conclusion : Samsung did sacrifices some awesome features from last year in order to get this phone done . Like removable battery and water resistance , but without these features galaxy s6 is still the best phone on the market as for now !!",NaiKang he,Samsung_S6,4
12 of 12 people found the following review helpful,4,,"on May 25, 2015","I’m going to start this review with full disclosure: I am more of an Apple guy than an Samsung guy. So, this review has the potential to a little biased. With that said, I did try to maintain an objective opinion about this phone and used it daily for a couple of weeks before writing this review. Design If design were the only criteria for this review, the Samsung Galaxy S6 would get 5 Stars. However, it seems that Samsung was ‘inspired’ by the iPhone 6 design and I’m a big fan of that style. In all fairness to Samsung, this is not a cheap knockoff of an Apple product. The phone feels nice in your hand and it is well made. One thing that I dislike about the S6 is how large the camera lens area is on the back of the phone. I tend to have my index finger in that area when making a call and it makes the S6 feel more bulky than it actually is. Screen The screen on the S6 is lovely. It’s main display resolution is 2560 x 1440 (Quad HD), which compares to the iPhone 6 with 1334×750 Retina HD display. Its color is very bright and is definitely on par with the iPhone 6 in my opinion. I found the touch screen to be responsive and saw no performance issues while using the phone throughout the day. Camera I hate to admit it, but I think this phone in general takes more crisp pictures than my iPhone 6. Sometimes more megapixels and the quality of the image sensor matter and it looks like Samsung found a nice paring for the S6. The Galaxy S6’s camera has an impressive 16MP, while the iPhone 6 has an 8-megapixel iSight camera. Software Because this is the latest and greatest hardware from Samsung, it runs comes equipped with Android 5.0 – Lollipop. It’s important to point out that the phone used for this review was a Verizon device. So, this was not stock Android. However, after personally experiencing some nightmares with bloatware installed on Verizon phones, I can honestly say it is not too bad on the S6. The one thing that did irritate me is that the default messaging app is Verizon Messenger. But, this can, of course, be changed. I have read online that it is possible to install stock Android on the Verizon S6 if one desired to do so, but we did not test this. Using the S6 The S6 was pretty intuitive. If you have used Android before, it will be easy to find your way around because the bloatware is limited and the nuts and bolts are pretty similar to a stock Android experience. Call quality was great and I experienced no issues with connection speed on WIFI or Verizon 4G. Final Thoughts If you’re in the market for a new Android phone, the Samsung Galaxy S6 is probably one of the best Android phones on the market right now. It’s fast and offers a solid alternative to Apple’s iPhones. This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for this review. I am a technology journalist and pride myself on providing fair and honest reviews. Please feel free to ask any questions you might have.",Nicholas Calderone,Samsung_S6,5

It is 28 times faster then the standard sd cards. People need to realize sd cards slow phones down! This technology allows Samsung to make a fast streamlined experience. Now as far as no removable battery, how many people do you know carry spare battery's in there pocket? I'll wait because there aren't that many. The phone has fast charging that allows you to get 4hrs of use with just a 10 minute charge. Wireless charging so there's no fuss to simply place your phone down and get a little juice. And ultra power saving mode that can give you almost 24hrs of use on just 10% of battery left, and to top it off you can fully charge your phone in 1 hour! So as I end this review remember that Samsung didn't take the Apple route like another guy said, Samsung did this when the technology available allowed it. Apple can't make none of these claims.

9 of 10 people found the following review helpful,2,,"on June 8, 2015","First of all this is an reasonably good phone. The reason i gave it two stars is for many reasons one of which is because the battery life is terrible. I have uninstalled most of the pre-installed apps and disabled the bloatware i cannot uninstall. Additionally the screen brightness is low and all automatic updates are turned off. I charge my phone to 100% unplug it and go to sleep in the morning sometimes it is as low as 40% remaining. In addition to having to recharge it in the morning i have to charge it again at around 2-3pm to ensure it lasts till i get home at night. The second problem i have is that the OS takes up 1.2GB of ram the apps which i have on the phone with isnt many, it is mostly mail clients. Take up another 1GB leaving only 600mb of ram free, I can easily see this phone slowing down quickly in future android updates that would eventually utilize more of the available ram. If you have the S5 there is no need to upgrade to this phone.",S. Seetahal,Samsung_S6,7
20 of 26 people found the following review helpful,4,,"on April 7, 2015","Admittedly I actually have the t-mobile version, which does automatically unlock 45 days after purchase and as far as I know should be the same as this version. Since I make the vast majority of purchases on Amazon, I thought I would share my initial thoughts on the phone here as well Samsung went and did it, no more ""plastic is stronger than glass"" or ""Apple fans are wall-huggers"" commercials from them! Pros: -For those who care, this phone has terrific build quality, and both looks and feels great in my hand -Excellent camera, probably the best Android phone camera to date -Display is just beautiful -Hardware, this will likely be the only none Snapdragon 810 flapship this year, that combined with Samsung's other hardware advantages gives this phone the fastest SOC, memory, and harddrive on the market. Mediocre: -Samsung supposedly made removing bloatware easier, you can just click on anything with a (-) sign to ""remove it"". but for a lot of the real bloatware both from samsung and other companies, this only disables the useless apps. So in the end Samsung made disabling bloatware easier, but not really removing them. -Back camera protrudes quite a bit. Cons: -the LED lights to the ""return"" and ""multitask"" buttons to the left and right of the home button cannot be controlled. this may seem like a small issue, but they light up for about 1.5 seconds EVERYTIME you touch the screen, it is a minor annoyance during the day and a major issue at night. Not to mention this wastes battery. I hope this will be fixed with a software update soon. -Battery-life is mediocre at best. This phone will last you through the day as long as you're not playing games or watching movies, and only write a moderate number of emails. Samsung wasn't lying when they said this phone charges fast, so for those of us who have a desk job this isn't a problem, but if you're outdoors all day you should carry a back up battery -that reminds me, did I mention no more removable battery and microSD? I didn't but other people did? good enough Comments: I don't understand the obsession with making a phone thinner every year, especially when a camera sensor need to protrude significantly to capture a nice image. Honestly this phone could've been perfect for me if it was 2mm thicker, without the protruding camera, and had approximately double the battery life (2mm thicker is enough space for it)",J,Samsung_S6,8
9 of 11 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 13, 2015","For Verizon edition. Read plenty of online reviews about the Edge before preordering it, most mentioned the ""gimmick"" that is the curved screen because of lack of functionality. To my mind this is a little like saying flat panel computer monitors were a gimmick because they did everything a CRT did -- they showed the picture, after all, they were just skinnier. ""All show, folks, nothing here to see, move along"" Not so much. Now, what is a gimmick is the software that has been developed in order fend off complaints that the curved screen's real-estate isn't used efficiently. Edge contacts? Not all that essential or useful. Edge notifications? Same deal. What is really impressive is the effect the curved screen has on my viewing experience. One reviewer on another site wrote ""gives the disturbing impression that the screen is falling away from me."" I balked at this because my experience is precisely the opposite, specifically that the screen is rising up to me. I hesitate to call it a 3D experience because that cheapens a true 3D display through something like MagicLeap, but it truly gives the impression that the screen has depthbecause, well, it does. This is particularly noticed when using ""carousels"" to swipe through items on mobile websites & apps, e.g. Netflix. The items roll up one side of the screen then off the other to produce a more immersive experience. Same can be said about scrolling on Web pages while in landscape mode. Another cool/useful effect is when watching videos the ""edge"" is blacked out preventing distortion of the image but also provides a little extra screen space for widescreen movies. Also when swiping down to check notifications/battery life the notification & progress bar make use of the edge; in effect using less screen space & obscuring less of the video. The QHD display is also excellent with no pixellation visible under a hand lens. Enough about the screen. Processor & RAM make Android 5.0 run like a dream. I owned an S5 before picking up this gem & seriously regretted updating to Lollipop because the S5 just didn't handle it well -- abominable battery life, laaaaag, & it required multiple restarts through the day. None of these problems are evident on the S6. Battery life is good, but not excellent. Can stream videos for about six hours before it needs to be charged & survives a typical day with intermittent usage for ten to twelve hours. The real improvement here is the inclusion of wireless charging. I decided to forego the add-on backplate/battery for the S5 so I picked up a few wireless charging options this go around & I'm thrilled with the functionality. I have one in my car, on the end table, the bedside table & my desk. The convenience of being able to just drop/dock-&-go cannot be overstated & as a result my battery is seldom below 70%. The only improvement I can imagine is if they could figure out how to make my body a wireless charger. TouchWiz is a bit of a let-down, but not significantly so. It is stripped down so I'm not completely inundated with an UI that had the feeling of being added to with each iteration to ""improve"" it, as if adding every spice in the cupboard makes for a better soup. The app drawer is my biggest irritation because it is entirely inconvenient. Newly installed apps are added to the end of the list but apps can be sorted into alphabetical order by touching the A-Z at the top of the list. Now why is this irritating? First, it needs to be done each time you install an app. Second, while you can customize the app list to include your most frequently accessed apps on the first page so you don't have an entire screen dedicated to app icons that should properly be housed in the app drawer, the customization process is poorly designed, unintuitive & languid in end-user implementation. Third, after spending a great deal of time customizing the first page of the app drawer the next time you want to sort your apps alphabetically you lose all of your customizati",Amazon Customer,Samsung_S6,9

It is a beautifully designed device, easily handles even the most demanding apps, and has more features than I will ever use. The reduced Touchwiz interface is a joy to use, and greatly improved over previous versions. I can say without a doubt this is my favorite phone I've ever owned. I do want to note that this is an international version. As such I was surprised, though I shouldn't have been, to discover upon opening that I'd received the Italian version of it. This means the manual and the wall charger are both the Italian versions, too. The seller was kind enough to include an EU to North American adapter so I can plug it in. Initial setup was a breeze, with language selection being one of the first screens upon powering it up. The utilities folder was still named instrumenti, but aside from that localization switched entirely to English without any problems. I read a different review that said they got the French version, so it seems there's no way to know what you'll get until you get it. I still think it's an excellent product and well worth carrying an adapter around with me since my carrier doesn't sell the S6 yet. Five stars!",Kristopher Wood,Samsung_S6,10

Install Flash Player I bought the Samsung Galaxy S6 directly through Verizon. Myself and my family tend to be Samsung users - smartphones, tablets, camcorders, Blueray players... so yes, I do have Samsung loyalty, yet I have to say the non-expandable internal memory is a bit of a bleah. I purposely got the 32GB as a) I am not one to fill up memory (never have been) and b) the extra hundred bucks for a 64GB seems ludicrous. Initial available memory is at approximately 22GB after all the updates... and the updates just keep coming, day in, day out. Some you can remove completely (if its listed under the APP windows, you can), rest you can disable, yet at times I have noticed there are ones that will suddenly re-activated and download the updates again. I have had this issue with my Samsung Tab 3 10.1"", too. When you plug the S6 into a PC (mine is Win 8.1 64Bit), you should be prompted to download and install a handler program for PC/S6 data transfers. I did get a very odd error though with some Amazon music tracks I transferred this way - standard MP3 format, but for some reason an error popped up as corrupted files. These were from two specific album collections (Instrumental Beats), yet the other album collections play fine. I can only assume it had something to do with the Samsung transfer software since I have the same tracks on multiple other Android devices, and never seen that error before. This can get quite warm with prolonged use. It gets a bit uncomfortable to the hand if no case is on. I currently use a UAG military-drop case, so it's no longer an issue. Strong, quick Bluetooth connections. Has NFC pairing - something I only discovered today while exploring the settings. Cool! The camera is great, of course, and the included photo editor is as robust as many Android Photo Editor I have evaluated. Fantastic display - fairs very well even in direct, bright sunshine. No problems with phone audio. I have to scratch my head in perplexity over other reviews say terrible reception. I can only guess it's a carrier-to-carrier issue? As for the ""bending"" complaint, that one also puzzles me. Yet I do have mine in a case, so perhaps that is the needful thing. Contact list includes Auto-Reject (something I had really wanted on my last phone) 4G support of credit card transactions. Has made my laptop home-visit repairs a better, more assured experience. ;) The aspect I personally love the most is the wireless charging - that is a pretty big plus in my book. The batter can dwindle relatively quickly, but by surrounding my self with wireless QI charging options (home, car travel, even a wireless charging power bank), it really is a moot thing. Standby time is strong; Samsung does shine in that respect. I hadn't known about the non-replaceable battery until after purchase... not sure how I feel about that. All in all, it's the slight doubt about only going with 32GB that bothers me, and I will burn the non-replaceable battery aspect bridge when I come to it down the line.

16 of 22 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 6, 2015","Wow, what a difference a year makes. While last year's S5 took many steps in the right direction(being somewhat waterproof with better material and craftsmanship), it still wasn't there to make it a mouth-watering phone yet, like what HTC did when they first introduced their One M7, or whenever Apple introduces a new iPhone size. This year, Samsung has finally learned from both of their competitors, and made a phone that has all the good qualities of both, plus some of their own. Finally, this is the Galaxy S that you've always wanted and been dreaming of. * The very first thing you notice when you handle the phone, is its new design and form factor - finally Samsung has completed their transformation of getting rid of all that ugly plastic parts. Now it is just all glass and metal, and now it is truly beautiful. The metal fully wraps around the edges ofthe phone. The back is beautiful, the sides are beautiful - heck, even the buttons are beautiful. It feels great in the hand, and oozes style and sophistication. * The very next thing you notice, of course, is the screen. I am continually pleasantly surprised at the evolution of Samsung's AMOLED technology - it has now became the best screen in the industry, hands down. I used to defend the LCD technology of the HTC M7, and at that point it was in fact overall superior to the Samsung S4 because the AMOLED then had issues in the sun, and color reproduction(it was too saturated and not natural). But now, they have fixed those issues, and the S6's screen is just quite simply the best. If you don't believe it, just compare an LG/Samsung OLED TV to any LED TVs today. I still think 5.1 inches for a screen of a PHONE is still too big, but overall, for what smartphones represent nowadays, it is acceptable - we have conditioned ourselves to accept the bigger sizes of smartphones(I remember when I first held a 4.2"" smartphone when it first came out - the HTC HD2 - and thought, ""what the h3ll is this monstrosity??""). * It doesn't hurt that Samsung boosted up the resolution to 1440 x 2560 pixels, which is approximately 577 ppi in pixel density. Although this is quite overkill right now, it's always nice to have the latest and greatest technology - that's the reason why we buy these overpriced phones in the first place, isn't it? It is also very bright, and sunlit legibility is excellent. Color reproduction is quite accurate, and like the S5, you can choose different color modes to suit your liking. * An important aspect to discuss is the battery life, now more than ever because there is no removable back cover to make replacing the battery easily like before, not to mention there is no microSD slot for you to add memory space to your phone. Comparatively, the S6 Edge is supposed to last a little less than the S6 regular, which I've read is less than last year's S5. But I'm one of those who are always around a charger, and I always carry external battery packs in my backpack when I travel, so that's never a concern. Seriously, who even buys an extra battery anymore - which you can only use for a single specific phone model - when your external battery can charge ANY and ALL phones and tablets?? This scenario only makes sense if your work is so demanding that you don't have extra time to charge the phone, and need to swap batteries IMMEDIATELY. I don't think that scenario is realistic nowadays when external batteries are so small, light, and cheap. My S6 goes from 100% at 10 am to about 20% at 10 pm with moderate use - so no complaints there. I get home, plug it up, and there are no issues. * What's better this year, is the wireless charging standards are already built into the phone, so you can just buy a charging pad for about $50 and feel even more cool. * The missing microSD expansion issue is a legitimate concern, since everyone loves to store their music, videos/movies, and all their apps in their phones. Now, you have to be selective and choose what to include or not. But I also have ",Johnny Amazon®,Samsung_S6,13

It just feels much more comfortable in the hand. Secondly, the screen looks much crisper and cleaner than the S5's although both have very good displays. Other main changes: The power button on the right hand side has been lowered down so it naturally sits where your thumb is most likely to be. The finger scanner is now press and not swipe. This makes it a much more accurate and quicker too. Whilst you lose the waterproofing, the annoying charge cover is gone, as is the wider charging port (if you have the wider charging cable you can't use it!). The speaker has been moved to the bottom and is much much more powerful. I was really surprised by how big the sound is from this. The battery is now sealed and the back cannot be removed. Whilst this is a slight nuisance, in the long run it will benefit users by making the lifetime of the battery longer. No Micro SD card slot. That's right. This is the most annoying feature of this phone and if you bought the 32GB model you will probably run out of space sooner or later. There are some external micro USB memory sticks out there though so all is not lost. Gorilla glass is now sported on the back too, which also happens to be a finger print magnet because of it. Fast charging! It really does charge fast now which is an absolute godsend. Wireless charging. Yup, if you buy the wireless charging pad that is. 8 cores, 64bit. Okay, so the more obvious differences aside, the phone has benefitted from a much better camera which actually does take great pictures that are noticeably better than the previous model. The extra screen pixel density also allows you to squeeze more out of your home screens. Talking of the home screen, it feels much more responsive too, gliding between screens much quicker and smoother. In my particular model the app tray doesn't feature a way to sort the apps so that is a minor niggle that will no doubt be fixed in the future but it is a surprising oversight. So, overall this is a really great piece of kit from Samsung who seem to have really made an effort this time around. The previous model seemed to be more about cramming in new features instead of making a really great phone. Everything about this feels well engineered, thinner and more ergonomically tuned. I really was annoyed about the memory and battery but after having the phone for a mere 24 hours I am absolutely sold.",Henrietta Emerick,Samsung_S6,14

But after two weeks of day to day use, and comparing with my old Galaxy S5 and Iphone 6 plus, I am really completely satisfied with the quality of the product. The drawbacks are not important, since the battery supercharge fast, It charges 100% in about an hour. It lasted until 4 oclock in a intense use day, then I charge it for 20 minutes for the rest of the day. Problem solved. Galaxy S5 needs 3 hours to charge up, Iphone 6+ uses almost 4 hour. In the old days, I use 2 replaceable batteries in my Galaxy S5, charging them for 6 hours or more. The quality of the product is also incredible. The screen is super sharp for everything, specially for watching streaming. The speed is awesome, using the same app in S6 and Iphone 6+ for streaming soccer game, the S6 is much fluent and perfect streaming, in the Iphone 6+ it stops repeatedly before it shows the contents of the video, using the same app and the same wifi or mobile network.

On normal use emails and phone this isn't an issue for the normal workday. However, add in any type of app usage and the battery drain is considerable. Battery Cases: I'm sure Mophie makes a stellar case however, why add such mass to such a slim phone. So that leaves me with the rest of the ""ultra slim"" Battery Case field the feedback is far too early on the 3500mAh rechargeable battery Cases such as Trianium Atomic , ZVOLTZ,, Stalion, Caka and 1Byone for me to pick a clear one to test.

The screen on the S6 is at or above the quality of the iPhone 6, very readable in bright sunlight, very crisp. Call quality is superb (I changed from my Nexus 5 because the speakers were damaged and since I had just fixed the broken screen I decided not to fix the speakers and instead just do an upgrade). Build quality is comparable to the iPhone 6 but surprisingly as light as the Nexus 5. Simply a beautiful phone. Battery life has been great: I've gotten reached 37% @ 10pm but bear in mind I am not the heaviest user but I would say it is better than both the Nexus 5 and iPhone 6 (which I used even less of).

The speakers are also fairly loud and deliver good sound when I am listening to music or watching a movie without portable speakers. The apps are quick, but tend to ""stop working"" a lot. The number of apps that are pre-loaded are ridiculous. Why do they keep putting NFL games on my phone.... Not to mention that I've never once accessed this app and it will say all of a sudden that my NFL app has stopped working. This makes me believe that the sole purpose is to drain my battery life and data. My biggest complaint with this phone is the battery life and the inability to talk on the phone and access data at the same time. This was something that I took for granted with my last phone. So, I can't access my google calendar and talk to someone to schedule an appointment at the same time. LAME!

,4,,"on September 23, 2015","The Samsung Galaxy S6 is intended for any smartphone customer who is looking for a new phone with the latest technology. When I reviewed this product I took into consideration the durability, camera, resolution of the screen, storage, size, price, and battery. I compared this phone to its leading competitor, the iPhone 6s. At the end of the day I give this phone a 4 out of 5 rating. After purchasing my Samsung Galaxy S6 in April, I immediately put a case on it. I haven’t had any issues with the durability for the short time I have owned it, but it is tough to justify with a case on it. The camera offers a 16 MP primary camera and a 5 MP secondary while the iPhone 6s offers a 12 MP primary and a 5 MP secondary camera. The display has been phenomenal and offers a 577 ppi (pixels per inch) which blows away the competition in this category. The iPhone 6s is at 326 ppi which is far below the Samsung Galaxy S6. The price of the Samsung Galaxy S6 is a competitive price when comparing it to other newer smartphones. The battery has been a slight letdown for me because it hasn’t allowed me to get a full days use out of it. Also the battery is non-removable which I see as a negative because you can’t buy back up batteries to replace your dead battery. The positive in the battery of the Samsung Galaxy S6 is the fast charging the phone offers. This phone charges fully in 1.48 hours which is the fastest 0 to 100% charge any smartphone offers. This phone offers quick processing and high quality components at a reasonable price. I didn’t give this phone a 5 out of 5 because of the battery, but the fast charging element makes up for the non removable battery. I would recommend this phone to anyone who is in the market for a new smartphone because of the exceptionally high quality components of the Samsung Galaxy S6.",Joseph,Samsung_S6,34

As so many other people and reviewers from various magazines have said the screen is stunning... the highest resolution I have ever seen or need to see! I have the 32 gig model, plenty of storage for me despite the device lacking a micro SD card slot. Given that could storage is so prevalent today the lack of a slot isn't much of a player. The tech specs on this device are top shelf and blow me away (note: I work for a HUGE competitor and this phone tops what we offer...). It's beyond capable for the average user and even techno geeks! I've seen a ton of reviews claiming the need for a skin because both sides of the thing are glass and will get covered with fingerprints within seconds... WRONG! The glass is oleophobic... it repels oil and, thus, fingerprints. I can't get a print on it to save my life! Now, there IS an issue with glass on both sides, at least for me... it's SLIPPERY! Regardless of which side is down the phone wants to run away. Park it on a sofa and, like water would, it heads for the low point. It's hidden itself from me on a couple of occasions leaving me a bit tweaked at myself for sitting it where I did. So, a skin might help in that regard. The camera is the best I've ever seen on a phone. The 16 megapixel sensor means fantastic resolution on photos and allows for remarkable poster size images should you want to get them printed. It has an f1.9 lens and that does mean less depth of field but, hey, it's phone... not a DSLR. I""m very impressed with the bells and whistles, though. Burst mode is fabulous. Hold down the on-screen button and it captures as many images as you would like... select the one you like most and dump the others! Also, it has a 'virtual shot' mode that allows you to position an item and move the phone around it in a circular fashion to produce what is, in effect, a 3D tour of the subject. Video is shot in true HD with results that rival my JVC... nice. Now, you need to take this with a grain of salt. I know our company's devices extremely well and now I know the S6 really well. Most likely other phone have similar features but I'm not aware of them. What I DO know for sure is that it's tough to beat this phone out.. end of story.

2 of 3 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on July 5, 2015","I am evaluating the Galaxy S6 920F through a narrow lens. We upgraded to Galaxy S6s from Galaxy S2s, and until now, we have purchased our phones on contract through AT&T as our carrier. We bought two phones through Amazon (Tek Deals). The phones arrived on time and in sealed boxes with a separate two prong European to US power adapter that fits on the European round pin charger. In both phones, the adapter fit too loosely over the European pins, and appeared unable to stay connected with any kind of minor jostling of the cord. Fortunately, the adapter was easy to take apart and I used a pair of pliers to squeeze the spring clip legs together, which easily fixed the problem. Of course, the adapter does make the charger stick further out. Our old S2 chargers will work, but the charging rate is lower, because they are only 1A chargers, rather than the standard 2A fast charger that comes with the S6. We took the phones to our local AT&T carrier store, and obtained SIM chips; I was pleased that the SIMs and switch over was free ( at least in our area). Coming from the Galaxy S2 to the S6 constitutes a big uptick in speed of everything, from downloading to app loading and operation. The screen is not only larger, but as expected, much sharper. We downloaded the Samsung Smart Switch mobile apps to the new and old phones to transfer as much information as possible. The app worked great. Google accounts transferred seamlessly, but some other accounts manually updating the username and passwords. Of course, all the wifi routers passwords had to be added manually. One feature missing on the phone, which apparently exists on US carrier branded phones, is the ability to alphabetically arrange apps with a one button click. At this time, apps are organized by when they were downloaded. App reorganization is a manual operation that can take quite a bit of time. I was used to seeing 4G/LTE on the notification panel on our old branded S2s, but on the 920F, only ""4G"" shows up. This worried me, despite researching that the necessary channels for 4G/LTE are active on the phone. From reading, and I believe, editing out misinformation on some sites, the international version only shows ""4G"", which is ""4G/LTE"". As noted by others, updates seem to just keep coming over a couple of days, but compared to an S2, the updates happen several times faster. The phone is slippery; wife already dropped hers once, and it was only one day old! Fortunately, no damage. New case will help. A concern, like for others, was battery life. It is often very difficult to compare usage from other users, who too often complain about battery life, without a hint about their usage. We live around 1/4 mile from the nearest cell tower, which is line of site, so 4G communication is quite good. Our wifi routers are generally within 50 ft of where the phones are used in our multilevel home. Wifi is used on an intermittent basis for updates or adding apps or heavy browsing sessions, to ensure staying under our carrier plan data cap. I am definitely a low level user, checking weather several times a day, reading and composing a few messages a day with or without attachments, an occasional email, and taking several camera shots a week. Syncing is set to automatic. I do not listen to music on the phone, or watch videos during the test periods. I may average a couple of calls a day. I may use a browser several times a day in either 4G/LTE mode or wifi. There were a number of updates or apps downloaded during the test measuring periods.. With power saving mode activated, I monitored my average battery usage over several charges. After 32 hrs battery reserve was down to ~65 %. Somewhere between 46 hrs to 67 hrs, battery reserve was 53%-56%. A worst case was leaving wifi on for about 10 hours, which drained the battery to 65% capacity in 23 hrs with minimal use (mianly overnight). Obviously, as a low level user, close to a cell phone tower and wifi routers, these values represent a minimal",GaryD,Samsung_S6,36

I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. Samsung Galaxy S6 tries to be a revolutionary, but it is evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. So do check local specs. I played around with both S6 and S6 Edge for few days and my opinions are based on this. There are tons of reviews going into lot of details, so I am focused on few other aspects like what’s out there and how to compare specs. First Big Changes: No microSD or removable battery. I know many of you loyal Samsung fans says BUMMER! I was a die hard fan of Samsung till S4, then I went to LG G2/G3. I think this is the best bet for S6 to pull it off after a dismal year for Samsung last year. I was very curious to try out S6 and HTC One M9 as they are most talked about now. Many manufacturers are going away from microSD card slots and this is absolutely a must and is a key differentiator from iPhone. I am really sad Samsung decided to drop microSD card slot as well as no removable battery. Why?! Screen is a beauty on S6 – Just Gorgeous. Just go to a retail store and feel it! The Edge feature is still gimmicky. Unlike Note Edge, this has both sides so less dorky but still I am not sold yet. Unless you have loads of money, I will shy away from it for one more year and get it next year when they polish it up. It is certainly fancy and nice to show off, but I would rather buy an Android wear watch like Motorola 360 or Samsung Gear or LG R series. I like Motorola 360 but waiting for version 2 to appear. I like Round watches. IF YOU HAVE LAST YEAR model of any phone, PLEASE DON’T upgrade. Phones are becoming so standard and power packed it makes no sense to upgrade and waste money every year. I buy and sell so many phones as it is like a hobby for me, but I stick to one phone as primary for couple of years now. My main requirements are a 128 GB microSD, good screen, battery life and performance. I am trying hard to see if I can live without one. S6 and S6 Edge comes in a 128 GB variant and I will wait for prices to stabilize on this model. In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size, weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice.

,5,,"on September 19, 2015","After trying my hand on everything from symbian to ios to windows phone to android, I was not going away from android any time soon.In terms of hardware also I have tried them all and the only problem with android phones was that they were kind of ugly.Then came this phone.They have been calling it the best android phone ever and I can even dare say its the best value you can get for a phone presently.I really don't have anything remotely down the negative side from my experience of 2 weeks.some say the battery wont last long,its as good as any other phone I had and its definitely not super but 12 hours average with normal usage is enough for me (and using the power saving mode can squeeze out a couple of extra hours).Another thing that some people may find a negative is non expandable memory, well again atleast for me 32 gigs is pretty cool and you always can dump stuff on your computer and the cloud (dropbox,google drive,onedrive so on..).Paying for storage (its the cheapest component in any device) in not something anyone should be doing (unless you are a corporation). I will be surprised if any phone in the near future will be able to beat this one in terms of value.",ankur samantara,Samsung_S6,39
,2,,"on August 6, 2015","I purchased the S6 from Tmobile since they were giving away a full YEAR of Netflix along with it as an incentive. I'm sorry I did, and for one reason only: Poor Battery Life. I've been using smartphones for many years as an early adopter. My first smartphone was the Treo 600, which I began using the day Sprint introduced it. Over the years I've used them all, and each year they get thinner, and the batteries get smaller. I cannot go a full day with this phone without plugging it in, and this is after TWO updates from Samsung, via Tmobile, to address battery life issues. It's a shame, because this is an amazing phone. But if the battery dies, its not a phone at all--It's just a lump in your pocket that has no value whatsoever. People I've spoken with make the same complaints about their Iphones, the problem is even worse with them. I'm going to get a new phone just as soon as I can find one with a big battery, perhaps a Blackberry Passport, which supposedly has very long battery life.",Amazon Customer,Samsung_S6,40
,4,,"on August 10, 2015","Works with T-mobile in the US and works with swedish sim-cards. Got a European charger, and a small adapter for US/JP. The device is very good looking compared to the other phones in the Galaxy S family. The fingerprints on the back however are easy to spot. But that is probably because i chose the Black color, the other ones probably won't have that issue. The biggest downside is the non-removable battery, which means in about 2-3 years when the battery turns into s***, you'll need to send it in to samsung or whatever for a replace. Not being waterproof like its predecessor and not being able ot use an SD-card sucks too. But i can live with that. It feels good in the hand, but is a bit slippery, especially if you put it on your lap etc. but a good phonecase will solve that issue. Right now i have the Neo Hybrid case from Spigen. It keeps the metallic look of the bumper and has a textured back for grip.",Alah Al-Harbi,Samsung_S6,41

Everything works and everything was included in the box that should have been included. My phone was not working at first and I was about ready to go ballistic. Googled the problem, troubleshooted, fixed in like 5 minutes. Bought from DeltaMobiles and the phone arrived early and tamper sticker was still intact. It doesn't say I have 4G LTE on my phone but its going as fast as my old phone that said 4G LTE so its working for me. Impressed with the phone and the updated OS.

The Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge have the quality engineering and craftsmanship to go head-to-head with the iPhone 6. Samsung has gone to great lengths to pay attention to detail and provide an exceptional smartphone experience. The Galaxy S6 Edge is cool, but the things that make it unique just don’t impress me that much. I’d recommend just going with the regular Galaxy S6 if you’re in the market for a new Android smartphone.

I was looking forward to charging my phone on wireless charging pad at night, but unfortunately the charging notification sounds intermittently throughout the night as the phone trickles down and recharges.

It doesn't have the ability to expand storage compared to other Samsung models I have seen that have a slot for a micro SD card. In short, there's no convenient way to open the back to gain access to the battery and the micro SD card slot. Other than that, it's a great phone.

The battery can quickly run out, certainly not able to run for whole day light activity. What worse about Samsung is the customer service. At first time I had contacted Samsung customer service rap. online, I was told to go to a LA downtown service center, even thought I told him specifically I have an international model which is not affiliated with any carrier in US. After almost 1 hour of driving in heavy traffic and searching for parking, I was only told by the girl in front desk that they do not service international model. After that, I called customer center and asked what to do, the girl simply give a simple instruction to turn on the phone on safe mode, then promised me to call back within an hour, which has never arrived. After I called second time and repeating my phone's problem, I was given another ticket number and told that a technician will call me within 24 hours. Again it did not arrive. I will never buy a Samsung products in any kind. It is not surprise Samsung company profit and stock value went to record low. I just bought a Chinese made P7, which is much better in quality although the hardware is not better than S6. But the price I paid is only half of what Samsung and service I am getting is way better experience. So long, Samsunk!",Sam Sun,Samsung_S6,59

1 of 2 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on June 30, 2015","The galaxy s6 edge is everything you could ask for in a phone. I bought this phone after being an iPhone user for 3 years. I was looking for something new and the galaxy edge did not disappoint. It comes in three colors black, gold, and white with two versions the regular one and the edge version. The basic model starts with 32gibs with a price of 699. The new slim design sets apart from any other phone. You will get attention anytime you pull it out. It fits in any type of life style. If you’re looking for a phone with a fast processor or just a very sexy phone for everyday use this is the phone for you. When you have it in your hand you can really tell it was well worth the money. This phone has many positives and very few negatives. The only real complaint about this phone is that it is hard to find a case and the edge doesn’t have any real use except for giving the phone a whole new look. POSITIVES Appearance The galaxy s6 is totally different from any other android phone in that it is now made out of all glass and not just any glass gorilla glass. This glass is one of the strongest glasses for phones out there. One reviewer said,” Samsung has completed their transformation of getting rid of all that ugly plastic parts. Now it is just all glass and metal, and now it is truly beautiful.” I agree completely android is known for using cheap plastic for their phones but that is not the case for this phone. Even though it is gorilla glass I would still strongly recommend getting a case. I know a naked phone galaxy s6 looks appealing but you shouldn’t take that risk. The camera on the back is raised out of the back of the phone which can get the lens scratched but is highly unlikely. The phone fits perfect in your pocket and hand. I would say it is the perfect size for a phone. Camera The galaxy s6 has one of the best cameras a phone could offer. It comes with many different camera modes that you can have a lot of fun with. I personally find no need for my 300$ sony camera no more ever since I got this phone. It really makes the picture come out just like you would want it. Every time you use the camera you will feel like you’re a professional camera man. This camera will not disappoint and will make sure you will get the best picture for you to cherish for years to come. NEGITIVES Edge uses The galaxy s6 comes in two versions the regular and the edge version which is just extra screen that curves over your phone a little. The price difference is 100$. It does not have really any major use so it leaves you wondering is it worth the extra 100$? I personally thought the look it gave the phone was good enough to convince me to get. If you’re not worried about looks then maybe the regular version is for you. Yes the edge can’t do much for now but I am 100% sure big things will be coming soon that only will be offered with the edge version. Finding Cases Since the phone is an awkward shape there are not many cases out there on the market for it. For instance the two major case company’s otter box and life proof do not make cases for the edge model. Yes its heart breaking but it is not the end of the world. It might take you longer to find a case that fits your needs and style but the phone is worth the extra time. OVERVIEW/CONCLUSION I believe the positives weigh out the negatives 10 folds. The phone is amazing with tons of features that are mouth dropping. You might spend an extra 100 dollars just to have your”fav 5” contacts on the side but it will not disappoint in the long run. You are really getting a bang for your buck. Anything of this quality is well worth the extra time and effort. In conclusion, I would recommend the galaxy s6 edge to anyone. The appearance, performance, and camera are all top of the line. If you do not want to waste your phone on a phone that is going to be out of data in a year then get this phone. The galaxy s6 edge will still be one of the top phones for years to come. So get you a galaxy s6 edge and co",antonio,Samsung_S6,64

1 of 2 people found the following review helpful,1,,"on August 9, 2015","It is amazing to me that Samsung has succeeded in creating an absolutely horrible device out of such great hardware. The hardware is indeed state of the art: Amazing camera, plenty of storage, great processor. Yet the Samsung bloatware and their security settings have made it the worst phone I have ever had. The bloatware is merely annoying, using up all kinds of resources and generally buggy, so that it's interrupting things you're trying to do with some sort of bs that Samsung wants to notify you about. And the security policy is truly unbearable. At the moment, I'm deleting without backup (because impossible without unlocking) all my user data because the fingerprint security stopped working. And Samsung FORCES you to create a backup password that's so secure that you can't possibly remember it. Having tried the one I had written down as well as all of my normal passwords, I finally gave up and am now going through hours of wasted time setting up the phone again (the setup process is also unnecessarily tedious), won't have my photos, won't have numerous custom notes. I can't say enough bad about this phone. It's kind of like making a Mercedes but then adding some sort of elaborate key system that doesn't work very well and requires contacting the manufacturer to start your car when it doesn't. I will never by a Samsung phone again after this experience, and, since I have a contract for this one, I guess I'll just keep it for a little while (only have had it for a few months) more but with no security at all, assuming that's possible.",Marshall Farrier,Samsung_S6,66

I had to return the phone several weeks after I got it (2/4 phones had a defect, both being camera) and then I got a vrand new one and it has the SAME defect! The rear camera does not focus. I tap on the subject I want and it focuses on the background. It sucks because I really was looking forward to the camera. Now I have contacted samsung to return it AGAIN because aside from the camera and the sound it makes when ever it opens, it does not charge. I have to charge it wirelessly everynight and it's annoying to have to hold the pad up to it. I cleaned it properally to the best of my electronic knowledge and it still doesn't work. They want me to do a hard reset to prove it won't work but it's a MAJOR inconvenience and I can't sync it via a cord because it does not work. I'd do it via the cloud but on niether phones my pics and vids don't want to sync and an error comes up. So I will probably have to deal with it for the next 1.5 years but the camera issue bothers me so I'm doomed to unfocused pics and videos that when they focus have a ""lazy eye"" and it refocuses on the background. Aside from those issues, good speed and everything. I like the fingerprint scanner and audio settings (I'm an audiophile).

5 of 9 people found the following review helpful,4,,"on April 1, 2015","Numerous people are complaining about the lack of removable batteries, external microsd card slot, and no waterproofing. I love the Galaxy's previous generations and have them. Losing the battery replacement does suck, but there are plenty of compact battery backups reasonably costed. Samsung states the S6 will be able to charge for 10 minutes to get 4 hours of use. Of course I don't expect that from the battery backup, but it is an amazing new feature that will really help eliminate the need for another battery. I get that a lot of people want to keep the product well past their 2 year contract, or pass it on to someone else and the battery life degrades over time. Most will not though and upgrade as their contracts expire. Plus the battery can still be replaced with a little effort. Also my iPhone 3 still works after years of use for a full day. It doesn't have a removable battery. Yes, I actually use it. My Galaxy broke a month ago from my own misuse and am waiting to upgrade. Losing the sdcard slot is a plus in a lot of ways. Don't get me wrong because I am sad to see it go. Being able to change out music, games, and audiobooks etc on the fly was great. Especially when there is no signal while hiking and I can't stream. However, with my devices it rarely functioned the way it was intended. Not all apps could be moved over to it, some updates would still be downloaded to the internal storage, and certain apps would only read internal storage opposed to where the content was stored on the external card. Plus Samsung is providing cloud storage free for 2 years up to 115GB. Way more than you could store before. The S6 is able to access the cloud content quicker than an sdcard too. Now with that being said it is crucial you don't store sensitive data on the cloud. Nothing is truly secure. Those who want to imply security is greater on the sdcard are somewhat correct, but that is only because people usually aren't attacking individual devices. It is far easier to get the data from an sdcard form those that know about exploiting rather than pentrating tons of servers even when encrypted. I also understand others complaint that they do not have signal or unlimited data. For those the lack of sd capabilities will hurt more. I'm glad Samsung reworked the design of the phone to give it a better look. The previous versions have always felt cheap and dated. It does suck to lose the waterproofing feature in the S5. I also wish they went with an aluminum case than glass. I hate seeing fingerprints everywhere. For the most part its no big deal. The phone will be in a case. I prefer the caseless feel, but after losing 2 phones without them you learn your lesson. The phone's specs are a beast compared to most of the current market making it a real contender.",Tim,Samsung_S6,127

The construction of the phone seems more solid than the S4 that I am upgrading from. It seems to have more metal and less plastic. You can't get to the battery anymore, but that is not a big loss in my book for a more solid phone.The phone is fast and the screen looks great. Some of the new features like the fingerprint scanner are really useful. The S6 did not come pre-installed with as many applications as the S4 did.

But a few years ago, after the original HTC One, HTC joined Apple in producing a sealed, inaccessible unit. AAGGGH! So I switched from HTC to Samsung and have very happy with the Galaxies. Why, why Samsung? Why now with the S6 have you followed suit with Apple and HTC? I will not buy a phone in which the battery and memory are hard wired and not user replaceable. Fortunately I realized before ordering that the S6 has joined the Dark Side. Total idiocy destroying an otherwise fabulous phone. My Samsung 5 is still fine, but when it goes, I will have to find a new brand. What makes this all the more stupid is that the ""hands-on"" battery and memory card were what made so many people really like the Samsung Galaxy",Tom Suarez,Samsung_S6,189

Plus people who are on limited or shared data plans will end up having overages, plus once that time is up you will have to pay eventually for cloud storage. plus I WILL not put my data on servers. no thanks. Plus that battery estimate is only for general usage. when you are out and about and watching a stored or streaming movie, or taking several hours of 4k video, the battery even new, will wear down quicker. There was absolutely nothing better than slapping in a slim fully charged battery from my jean pocket to phone in less than 5 seconds, and being good for the rest of the day. If you're out and about and you are taking a lot of video, on the beaches or the trails, you will not find an outlet so you can plug in which you still need an outlet for ""wireless"" charging. want to carry a bulky, non water proof external charger, oh yea you still have to plug that too into the phone and that will only get you so much. Don't even want to get started on the NO micro sd slot issue. After being a Samsung Fanboy for years with owning Galaxy S2, S3, S4, Note 3 and preaching to everyone to get a Samsung, now you might as well preach to the choir. !00% absolutely will not be getting the Samsung Galaxy S6 for the first time ever.

44 of 48 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on May 9, 2015","As my name suggests, I am a college student so I mostly use my phone for texting, Facebook, Instagram and other social media. Thus I would say I'm not an intensive user of all of the phone's features. I also do not play any games on it as I prefer to use my iPad for that. That way I keep my phone's storage pretty much at less than 50%. I switched from a Galaxy SII the T-989 version two weeks ago and have never looked back. I had a 16GB microSD card on my old phone and at first was wary of not having an option for expandable storage but soon realized since the Galaxy S6 has 32GB of storage that's more than enough for me and my daily needs. Thus, the non-removal battery and lack of the microSD slot is a non-issue to me. This phone is certainly a huge upgrade for me, basically everything is different about it. My personal favorite features are the LED light which my previous phone lacked, the fingerprint scanner, and the fact that I am able to reply to a text message from any app because there are pop up notifications. Previously, I wanted to switch to the iPhone because it had those notification features like pop-up notifications and notifications on the lock screen but now that the Galaxy S6 has those too I no longer feel the need for an iPhone. As previously mentioned, I do not use my phone extensively so I've had no issues with it so far. It is smooth, responsive and fast. I haven't any issues with apps crashing or the phone freezing (knock on wood!). I also really enjoy the battery life. With my previous phone I would have to charge it twice in one day if I used it constantly, thus I resorted to using airplane mode to salvage my battery life. With this phone, I charge it every other day if I let it go from 100% to 5%. It also charges very quickly. 1 hour at the charger without using it can get me somewhere between 20-40% extra life (I haven't paid very careful attention to how much I get from an hour). As far as the design and the exterior goes. It is not as gold as I had expected. It's definitely not as flashy gold as the iPhone but I still like it. The phone is thin and light weight and took maybe a day or two to get used to from my previous phone. I do have a clear case on it from Best Buy which protects everything it needs to protect and has a good grip. I also noticed that the screen is less fingerprint prone because I can easily wipe it with a shirt or my pant leg and all my fingerprints are gone. Also, I bought this phone from the seller SHOPEBEST and there was absolutely no hassle. With Prime shipping the phone was in my hand in 2 days as promised. THERE WAS NO BROKEN SEALS OR DAMAGE TO THE BOX. The phone is international so I was expecting a foreign charger, my phone is from the UK which I am actually thankful for. It IS the model SM-G920F. Everything was in the box, the little thing to open the SIM slot, the headphones, all the little booklets of information, and the UK charger with an American adapter. The phone was in perfect condition, no scratches or little nicks. I have Walmart Family Mobile as my service provider and I had no issue switching my service from my old microSIM to the nanoSIM. It took maybe 5 minutes on the phone and 15 minutes later my service switched and the phone worked like a breeze. My 4G is also working perfectly. I ran a speed test on my old phone prior to the switch and on this phone and this phone has much faster download and upload speeds. I am attaching screenshots of the speed test results from the SpeedTest app as well as pictures of the phone.",College Student,Samsung_S6,264

While last year's S5 took many steps in the right direction(being somewhat waterproof with better material and craftsmanship), it still wasn't there to make it a mouth-watering phone yet, like what HTC did when they first introduced their One M7, or whenever Apple introduces a new iPhone size. This year, Samsung has finally learned from both of their competitors, and made a phone that has all the good qualities of both, plus some of their own. Finally, this is the Galaxy S that you've always wanted and been dreaming of. * The very first thing you notice when you handle the phone, is its new design and form factor - finally Samsung has completed their transformation of getting rid of all that ugly plastic parts. Now it is just all glass and metal, and now it is truly beautiful. The metal fully wraps around the edges ofthe phone. The back is beautiful, the sides are beautiful - heck, even the buttons are beautiful. It feels great in the hand, and oozes style and sophistication. * The very next thing you notice, of course, is the screen. I am continually pleasantly surprised at the evolution of Samsung's AMOLED technology - it has now became the best screen in the industry, hands down. I used to defend the LCD technology of the HTC M7, and at that point it was in fact overall superior to the Samsung S4 because the AMOLED then had issues in the sun, and color reproduction(it was too saturated and not natural). But now, they have fixed those issues, and the S6's screen is just quite simply the best. If you don't believe it, just compare an LG/Samsung OLED TV to any LED TVs today. I still think 5.1 inches for a screen of a PHONE is still too big, but overall, for what smartphones represent nowadays, it is acceptable - we have conditioned ourselves to accept the bigger sizes of smartphones(I remember when I first held a 4.2"" smartphone when it first came out - the HTC HD2 - and thought, ""what the h3ll is this monstrosity??""). * It doesn't hurt that Samsung boosted up the resolution to 1440 x 2560 pixels, which is approximately 577 ppi in pixel density. Although this is quite overkill right now, it's always nice to have the latest and greatest technology - that's the reason why we buy these overpriced phones in the first place, isn't it? It is also very bright, and sunlit legibility is excellent. Color reproduction is quite accurate, and like the S5, you can choose different color modes to suit your liking. * An important aspect to discuss is the battery life, now more than ever because there is no removable back cover to make replacing the battery easily like before, not to mention there is no microSD slot for you to add memory space to your phone. Comparatively, the S6 Edge is supposed to last a little less than the S6 regular, which I've read is less than last year's S5. But I'm one of those who are always around a charger, and I always carry external battery packs in my backpack when I travel, so that's never a concern. Seriously, who even buys an extra battery anymore - which you can only use for a single specific phone model - when your external battery can charge ANY and ALL phones and tablets?? This scenario only makes sense if your work is so demanding that you don't have extra time to charge the phone, and need to swap batteries IMMEDIATELY. I don't think that scenario is realistic nowadays when external batteries are so small, light, and cheap. My S6 goes from 100% at 10 am to about 20% at 10 pm with moderate use - so no complaints there. I get home, plug it up, and there are no issues. * What's better this year, is the wireless charging standards are already built into the phone, so you can just buy a charging pad for about $50 and feel even more cool. * The missing microSD expansion issue is a legitimate concern, since everyone loves to store their music, videos/movies, and all their apps in their phones. Now, you have to be selective and choose what to include or not. But I also have ",Johnny Amazon®,Samsung_S6,265

2 of 2 people found the following review helpful,3,,"on August 14, 2015","Pros: over all is a great phone and for most novices they won't miss anything. The 16 megapixel camera is great except for that it's hard to take pictures that don't blur from time to time. The 6+ edge plus add stabilization features. This comes in handy and is quite in addition but it's not on this model. Cons: Too much bloat ware. Especially with the Galaxy S6+ Edge, since you can't get as much options for storage memory (no 128GB) (and the infrared was removed) but at least it has more RAM by 1 GB, and a stronger processor, the Exynos 7422 which this model could have used both -especially the extra RAM with all the bloat ware. ( hint going and turn a lot of it off in application settings.) The BIGGEST CONS all the new flagship Samsung phones, the S6 line and the note 5 line of phones, is that Samsung stupidly, and with much resentment in the Samsung loyalist phone community, killed the removable battery and the external SdCard memory slot. This makes your need for upgrading your phone or repairing it much greater every year, as a typical battery depletes in recharge ability between 25 and 35% a year. that means if you got 20 hours a daythe first year by the second near your get maybe 14 worth of life a day, and you can't just replace the battery for $30 by ordering it on Amazon. The same is true for memory they want hundreds of dollars for upgrading your memory from 32 GB to 128 GB. When a 64 GB sdCard can be used for much of the storage for under $50. Their goal is to make money at the cost of the user and the convenience of the user. It should make you angry. if you keep your phone for 2 to 3 years he may have to repair it to three times to get new batteries installed and to keep the phone charge up, if you need it at max every day. I ordered a new battery every six months to do that. AND to keep memory off the main phone I just copied files from the main phone to the SDcard, Eventually when I got home or rather when I got time I would copy it off to my secure home network. But I also have a lot of apps. Samsung uses most of the main memory themselves. So you almost have to get the first upgrade if you're to use the phone in any way imaginable except as they recommend senior citizens do. Consumer reports words not mine. If you had an SDcard you can use an app to copy most of the apps memory to the SDcard. this saves too much money when it comes to options of memory upgrades. The other con I have is the sound is not the greatest on these phones. I really had hoped they would be a vast improvement from the previous version. I'm of course talking about the external sound for playing music. Yes I can use earphones but that's not what I'm referring to.",MB of USA,Samsung_S6,268

I live in an area with good to excellent LTE service and I have never had LTE on the Samsung S6 after four weeks of use. I am lucky to see three out of five bars for 4G. While at home, my Samsung S6 automatically defaults and enables Wi-Fi because of the very weak phone antenna. Bluetooth is another story because it crashes and then starts to repeatedly crash, recover, crash, and recover. Because of this, using the phone to talk in the in the car over Bluetooth is useless as well as playing music.

3 of 4 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 9, 2015","Oh, Another year 2015. Another set of phones from manufacturers! I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. Samsung Galaxy S6 tries to be a revolutionary, but it is evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. So do check local specs. I played around with both S6 and S6 Edge for few days and my opinions are based on this. There are tons of reviews going into lot of details, so I am focused on few other aspects like what’s out there and how to compare specs. First Big Changes: No microSD or removable battery. I know many of you loyal Samsung fans says BUMMER! I was a die hard fan of Samsung till S4, then I went to LG G2/G3. I think this is the best bet for S6 to pull it off after a dismal year for Samsung last year. I was very curious to try out S6 and HTC One M9 as they are most talked about now. Many manufacturers are going away from microSD card slots and this is absolutely a must and is a key differentiator from iPhone. I am really sad Samsung decided to drop microSD card slot as well as no removable battery. Why?! Screen is a beauty on S6 – Just Gorgeous. Just go to a retail store and feel it! The Edge feature is still gimmicky. Unlike Note Edge, this has both sides so less dorky but still I am not sold yet. Unless you have loads of money, I will shy away from it for one more year and get it next year when they polish it up. It is certainly fancy and nice to show off, but I would rather buy an Android wear watch like Motorola 360 or Samsung Gear or LG R series. I like Motorola 360 but waiting for version 2 to appear. I like Round watches. IF YOU HAVE LAST YEAR model of any phone, PLEASE DON’T upgrade. Phones are becoming so standard and power packed it makes no sense to upgrade and waste money every year. I buy and sell so many phones as it is like a hobby for me, but I stick to one phone as primary for couple of years now. My main requirements are a 128 GB microSD, good screen, battery life and performance. I am trying hard to see if I can live without one. S6 and S6 Edge comes in a 128 GB variant and I will wait for prices to stabilize on this model. In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size, weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice.

Computing power wise, it runs all its applications smoothly and flawlessly. Has a true dual-screen feature. The specs I'm not going into- they are published and lauded everywhere. I moved up from a Galaxy S4 and am glad that I did. Thank God that I skipped the S5. I was tempted to switch from a long run of Android phones to the Apple iPhone 6 and iOS but after actually comparing the two hands-on, I think Lollipop 5.0 is the best Android version yet. Essentially no different from the Apple in actual experience. I do not bemoan the discontinuation of the micro SD nor the removable battery. There are simply too many data storage options today to worry about the lack of an SD card. Don't care for company-provided off-site storage? Fine-- then get yourself a private home cloud. As for the battery, I love the addition of wireless charging; it's so simple and convenient. I never really had battery issues with my S4 battery life anyway, so I don't expect any with the S6. Besides, hasn't anyone else noticed the public charging station machines that are starting to pop up? Sure, it costs, but so did that extra battery. Long story short, if you were waiting for the right time to upgrade, this is it. I don't think you'll regret it at all.",Christopher Ford-Hayes,Samsung_S6,273

These are small issues, though, and they don't take away from me still loving it.",christine vanderkaap,Samsung_S6,277

Portuguese. French. There is only some asian languages and english. Also the travel charger had some strange plugs. You need to buy an extra adapter for use the charger.

,5,,"on July 22, 2015","What a phone!!!!! First of all, I've not bought the phone from Amazon. I have bought it from a local retailer. I'm not a Samsung Rep. who would give a biased opinion. By the way, i have always preferred LG devices than Samsung before S6 was introduced. Somehow Samsung UI was so cheap and the camera colors were too harsh!!! I've been using LG G2 for over 2 years and had been pretty happy with it. Have also used 5s in the past but was a turn off to me. Wanted to upgrade from there. Was stuck between Iphone 6, LG G4 and S6. Saw each of them quite closely in the shop and read a lot of positives and negatives of each: LG G4: A great phone with lovely display and camera and a sleek UI. But totally no value for money because it is being sold at around USD 600. Again, the pastic build looks terrible. Have been tired of it since the time I bought G2. Yes, I could have bought the leather one but personally I like metal over anything else! So, LG G4 was not for me!!! Iphone 6: 1. Is too expensive for what it offers (Screen size, resolution, camera etc.) 2. Poor resolution compared to the peers 3. Camera doesn't even come close to G4 or S6 4. IOS is so unfriendly. I read a lot of PDFs and I'm on the go most often. So, damn! how can I transfer the files from my office laptop to iphone without headache - I cant install anything on my office laptop? 5. Screen size is way too small (4.7) or way too big (6 Plus) bcoz of the stupid design - large bezels 6. I don't live in the US so anyways I cant make the most of IOS and I'm not even into gaming or an app freak! so Iphone is totally useless for me and offers a very very poor value for money, unless you want to sell phone every other day for which iphone has the best resale value:) S6: 1. Was a STEAL DEAL - I got it for net value of USD 465 because of the festive season sale. I bought 32 GB Gold and man - it looks such a killer!!! 2. Camera - Perhaps this is the most important thing I see in any phone - Brilliant Pics - I would say ditch your DSLRs and just go with S6, you will be 99% right in most lighting conditions. Bokeh effect is amazing as well and the macro pics are so so so lovely!!!! I took pics in very low lighting condition and they couldnt be any better 3. Build quality - Its all metal but still very light weight since its only 5.1 inches 4. Download booster - What a terrific idea - WiFi + Cellular to download huge files - I download large movie files with my S6 and it is super fast! No other phone offers this feature! 5. Amazing screen - Super Amooled screen is terrific - see it to believe it - Watching movies is a bliss! Non expandable storage? Is that a problem?? Not for me for sure - Why? I have APOTOP which can help me connect to my android phone and stream media files. I can connect my 1TB external device to APOTOP and can stream movies, music, pics etc. and even transfer pics from phone into the external disk without having a laptop. So, space isn't a concern at all for me!!!!!! (By the way, this is again where IOS frustrates the users! - My Apotop app in IOS opens but cannot play all movie formats!!! it only plays .MP4 format while the Apotop App for Android plays all formats) Battery - I was skeptical about this but to my pleasant surprise, I never found any issues with my devise. Today at 10AM, the battery was at 100%. Then I have been using the phone to check my emails and make / receive calls with some net surfing. Right now, its 4:30PM and the battery is at 71%!!! In fact, two days back when my battery was at around 75%, I started on to watch the movie FOCUS on my phone and when the movie completed, it was down to 54% - That's it???? For such a high resolution screen and display that kills Iphone in every way, shape or form, a drop of only 20-25% for a whole HD movie? I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase and can confidently recommend S6 to everyone (S6 edge isn't value for money for me since it was around USD 750 in my country - I dont find it worth spending extra US",Amazon Customer,Samsung_S6,280
,4,,"on July 19, 2015","I just recently got the S6 and I was a bit hesitant about doing so after coming over from the iPhone5 which I loved. At first the size of the phone can seem a bit overwhelming but in just a day you begin to adapt and realize how much better (by better I mean both the size and clarity of the screen is astounding). After a few weeks of usage I really love the android and the custom option I can have which is a huge plus compared to the iphone, but there are some drawbacks I have found. One is the overall life of the battery, with heavy usage it can drain pretty quick and even without much use it can still seem to drain quickly, as compared to what I imagined the life of the new battery would but this is easily overcame with the fast charger where in just 15 minutes you can get an ample charge to last you hours which in my mind balances that out. The second is the phone can be a bit glitchy or slow at times which is suprising seeing that the phone is just a few weeks old, but this might be worked out as updates come. The final complaint I have was the amount of bloat wear or pre loading apps that were on the phone. I had to spend most of my evening deleting or disabling ( apps that can not be deleted) and there was quite a few. But with a bit of persistance I got the phone situated to my liking and have loved the phone since the day I got it.",Mike,Samsung_S6,281
,4,,"on July 17, 2015","I am not going to write about the S6 but the fact that is the international unlocked version SM-G920F. If you were to buy this from AT&T in the states it would be $685. So for almost $200 less the unlocked version is a value. It is important to note that not all bands are available, so please research if your carrier will support this phone. Also there is some debate on whether AT&T in NYC provides LTE to this phone. My phone only says 4G, but some have said that the phone doesn't read LTE because this phone is for the English market and they don't refer to LTE. I tend to agree with this since when I look in the phone which bands my phone is using it says 17, which is considered LTE in the states. But what confuses me is the speed I am getting in NYC (midtown) only 10/7, which for me isn't slow but more HSPA+ speeds. Since this version was intended for the English market the charger has a UK plug and Samsung or the shipper included an adapter. Overall a great phone but just double check on the cellular capability. OH BTW by not going through a carrier you don't have the crazy amount of bloatware on the phone only Samsung's and Microsoft's which is more than enough already.",Joseph K. Rasero,Samsung_S6,282
,4,,"on July 20, 2015","The phone is very nice -- not too many bloatware, lightning fast, sleek, except, as reported in many places, the battery is not long lasting. On the other hand, the charging speed is superior -- less than 80 mins from 0% to 100% with the adaptive fast charger. The one start I'm not giving is for the phone not straight from factor. Claimed by the seller in the reply to my inquiry email as ""factory sealed straight from the manufacturer"", and in another email where I complained not true after getting it ""verified that there was not usage on this unit prior to it arriving to you"". But I still believe this is not true. Before opening the box, I saw a smaller factory seal (broken) covered by a larger one. After opening it, I immediately noticed a fingerprint on the phone protecting wrapper. I didn't return it because this was the 2nd time (returned once to another seller) and no longer wanted a 2nd long wait -- certainly, I checked the CPU/memory/SoC etc. to be the same as S6 specs before making the decision. In sum, this is an almost ideal phone. Buy it from stores if possible.",treul,Samsung_S6,283
,5,,"on August 8, 2015","I purchased this phone about three months ago through AT&T and I honestly love this phone. I love the size and the color I instantly gravitated towards this color of phone because while this phone is Gold it is more on the cool toned side which is a shade of Gold that I prefer to shades more on the warmer side. The phone is run on an android system which I find the easiest to navigate and The programs are fast. I have had little to no technical issues with this phone and the photo quality is amazing. This phone has a setting in the camera that I have not experienced on any other phone; it has the option for a ""wide selfie"" This is great for group picture as you take the photo and then slowly move the photo to the left and then to the right and makes group photos with multiple people possible without the selfie stick trend ( I also have a selfie stick but I tend to use my selfie stick at events with a lot of people as to allow for the height of people in front of me and for better video angles). If you are in the market for a new phone let me say that I believe that this is the perfect phone.",Taylor Agee,Samsung_S6,284
10 of 15 people found the following review helpful,3,,"on May 7, 2015","The phone is beautiful, however this review is specifically about this unlocked version of the Samsung Galaxy S6. I had the hardest time trying to get a network connection on this phone. I took it to the corporate store of my service provider (Metro PCS) and even they couldn't tell me why I couldn't get a network connection. Luckily the people there could refered me to someone who worked in the vicinity and knew about unlocking cell phones. He told me that because this is an International phone he had to install extra things on it to get it working. I have a 4G connection, not LTE. My guy told me LTE isn't capable on an International phone. So beware the extra steps you will have to take to get this phone working like it's supposed to. Despite that, now that I have a connection I do love it. Besides, there's really no difference between 4G and LTE.",Sasha Daniels,Samsung_S6,285
,5,,"on August 3, 2015","I normally go back and forth between Apple and Android but I started a new job so I bought the Samsung Galaxy s6 as a means of new efficiency. I think its great so far. PRO 1. Great UI. There are many things the user can control to his/her preferences which is a huge plus. Finger print password, managing apps, shortcuts, etc. 2. Great color and clarity of screen. Good use of large screen without feeling bulky. 3. Functionality. Works well with 4G. I've use Apple for most of my professional life and I can't believe how flawless and seamless the Android system functions. It hasn't crashed despite the memory-hogging, data-centric apps I use - unlike my previous iPhone. CON 1. One annoying thing was that my SIM card did not originally fit so I had to go to my local mobile store and get it cut - no charge ofcourse, but they did seem surprised that a new SIM did not come with the package as it seemed the norm. But that was a small inconvenience to bear.",HK,Samsung_S6,286

It actually justifies of being the 'latest' mobile gadget available in the market and it gives you every bit of it. Few points which make this one a must buy: SUPERB Gaming experience : I just couldn't stop myself from downloading a couple of games and the playing experience has been fantastic. UNBEATABLE Camera : Just give a cluck shot and you will fall for this one. DOESN'T HANG UP: Yes you heard it right,Get ready for a flawless experience.

I got the phone and I compared it's signal with my S6 Edge at&t version and this international version did show less bars but I believe it's because it's programmed slightly differently but the strength of the signal is the same if not better. I noticed that is some places where my at&t version couldn't load stuff because of a weak signal this international version loaded it my much better, also the phone came with the factory seal untouched, no fake one on top of it",Mahmoud,Samsung_S6,290

0 of 1 people found the following review helpful,1,,"on July 24, 2015","I'm shocked that Samsung is still producing a phone with a user interface that feels like 2003. This phone is running the latest version of Android, but it feels like the original version. Samsung loads tons of custom apps that are substantially worse than the Android default apps. Compared to base Android, it's incredibly hard to find basic things, such as how to uninstall an app, changing the background picture etc. I hate that apps like Facebook and Instagram cannot be uninstalled. I don't mind them being installed by default but I should be able to remove them. The only good I can say is that the phone is fast - it feels very responsive. The build quality is tolerable but it still feels sub-par for the price. Having now used: Galaxy S4, S5, S6, Nexus 5 & 6, iPhone 4S, 5, 5S & 6 - I would strongly recommend against the Galaxy line. When the day comes that Samsung figures out how to remove its customization to Android it might be worth considering. I really don't want a customized OS that makes my experience worse.",Peckles,Samsung_S6,360

1 of 3 people found the following review helpful,4,,"on May 2, 2015","Im a Walmart Electronics Associate, and was able to get an upclose view and useage of both the S6 and S6 edge, as well was able to have a personal chat with a worker from Samsung about the phone, the first thing i noticed about both was the sleek look of it, with glass on the back and a metal frame, it was a wonderful sight. After that was noticing the edge, a curved screen right at the edges, which made it my personal favorite. Two cons i noticed right off the bat, no replaceable battery, and no microSD slot, i can explain why there is no microSD slot, and its not due to their skills of making the cases. They found that their new style of hard drive which i heard was a form of hybrid ssd/hdd, was faster then any of the latest microSD cards, so instering one into the phone would simply slow it down whenever you wanted to access anything from the SD card. So a legidimate reason to not include a MicroSD card slot, luckly they provided that the smallest memory capacity the phone comes in is 32gb, unlike apple with their 8gb minimum. The battery is simply a special style, and it would have got rid of the beautiful style of the phone to make it replaceable. Now think about the screen itself, its pratically a glass screen protector built into itself, of course dont go dropping it becase i said that. Samsung went to great lengths to create a phone that had far less problems with the screen cracking, but still no system is perfect, although the screen is more durable then most of their competitors. I still, and i always will highly recommend getting a screen protector and case. The phone is very fast, switching instantly from apps, and even picture taking is unbelievable, with rapid photo taking if you hold the button down, and you can even tell it to take a picture like in the previous s5. The screen is beautiful, perfect detail for such a small phone, samsung i believe is the top picture quality producer among phones. But i cannot offer much more on the phone, since i was unable to use it for very long. Overall, i would buy it if i could afford it.",Andrew D.,Samsung_S6,383

I have a Samsung blu-ray player and it’s a very good blu-ray player. I have a Samsung Tablet and it is a great tablet. What the heck does this have to do with a Galaxy S6 Smart Phone review? Please keep reading I promise you won’t be sorry. First of all I just wanted to show that I am not a first time Samsung product buyer. I have many Samsung products that work great as well I have bought several of their smart phones all have been great phones. Until now. As I said I had the S4 my wife’s S3 took a dump so I reluctantly gave her my S4 and bought an S6. I had the new S6 phone for almost a week. It has some great new features particularity the ability to keep the phone from locking when connected to anything in the exclusion list. I have to use a password on my phone because its a personal phone I use for work mostly. I work 100% remotely from home I am on it all day every day. So, I need it to lock but love that the new feature will allow you to set an exclusion list of when and where to lock it. Anyway, I quickly realized that most of the new features, why I liked this new phone, worked intermittently at best. I soon noticed I was dropping almost every call I made, the phone just seemed to be cursed. So, I took it back to where I bought it and they gave me a new one, we both were thinking I just got a ""bad"" phone. I was very skeptical that I had just happened to get a ""bad"" phone I was convinced it was Samsung laying an egg with new technology. I thought crappy design and even worse mother boards. Man was I was right!!!! This second phone acted and did the same thingas the first. The battery lasts for like 30 minutes (being facetious) not too far off! and the new features continued to act the same way, worked intermittently at best and the phone just seemed to be cursed. NOTE: Man does this thing charge lightning fast and it better cause like I said the battery lasts for like 30 minutes. So, I called Samsung tech support and this is where things get interesting. I worked with tech support and they couldn’t fix it so they asked me to send it in so they could fix it. I sent it in and within a week I had the phone back! Hurray! Ummm, yea right, NOT! I quickly noticed it was not zeroed out to factory settings as they said it would be. They hadnt fixed it at all. I checked the box several times thinking there was some explanation as to what they found and --- NOTHING, ZILCH. There was no follow up call or e-mail or anything in the ticket online to say what they found either. So, I called them and they told me “it has water damage” we can’t fix it!?!?!?!?!?! WTF!?!?!?!? Guys I’m telling you, I have used two of these new phones both brand new out of the box and they both acted the same way - quite simply in short THEY SUCK! I will now come across as a disgruntled customer spewing silly rhetoric but I don’t care. What I am saying is all true and if my phone really had water damage then the serial number sticker I specifically left stuck to the back of the phone would surely have water damage, it does not. I DID NOT CAUSE WATER DAMAGE TO MY PHONE. I pleaded with Samsung to replace my phone and they said they would talk to their supervisor and call me back. Well, you guessed it no call back after a week so far. Quick NOTE: I was involved with the first Pentium PC processors when they first came out, the company I worked for got a bad first batch and the big blue company that made them and installed them had to replace about 150 mother boards in all the new PC's we purchased from that first batch. Point being, bad computer chips, bad mother boards and CPU's etc...does happen. Bottom line - please, please, DO NOT BUY THE S6, you will be sorry, especially if you use the phone for anything other than calls, texting or taking pictures. SAMSUNG LAID AN ABSOLUTE EGG WITH THIS NEW S6!!! And they screwed a regular guy like me by telling me Oh sorry, your ",synwave7,Samsung_S6,429

95 of 103 people found the following review helpful,3,,"on May 8, 2015","I just moved from the Galaxy Note 3 to the S6 Edge so my review is colored by that comparison. This wasn't the unqualified success I'd hoped for. The Good: o Cool factor. The edge screen is eye catching and a popular topic of discussion o Size. My Note 3 Phablet was too big. The S6 has a large screen but can be easily one-handed. o Speed. Generally speaking the phone is fast and responsive o Wireless charging. This built-in feature is by far my favorite upgrade. I have a charging pad on my nightstand and I can just lay the phone down to charge. If I need to read it during the night I'm not wrestling with wires. o Screen resolution. Insanely sharp and bright. The increased pixel density isn't necessarily noticable with the naked eye but I am a VR enthusiast and I can see a significant improvement when using Google Cardboard. I'm looking forward to getting the Samsung VR helmet later this year. The Bad: o Battery life - even with moderate use I have to charge once or twice during the day. o Hesitation - I use the same suite of apps as I did on my Note 3 but the S6 will hang up for no discernable reason where the Note 3 didn't. This is especally odd given the S6 processor upgrade. o Hand Feel - the edge feels like a fragile bird in my hand. The power and volume buttons are way to easy to press and the thin edge feels fragile. The cover I bought has considerably improved this situation. o Constantly waking up unbidden like an attention starved toddler. I'm not talking about bumping the power button. I'm talking about spontaneous wake up due to lord knows what - proxity to another phone, the power of my Aura when its in my pocket, a sideways glance. Its very frustrating and probably a big contributor to my battery life issues. I'm still looking for the ""shut the heck up until I call for you"" setting but so far no luck. I've never owned such a touchy smart phone. o The curved screen has some downsides. It warps the edge of images and some apps are hard to navigate if a control is near the edge.Overall I wish I'd bought the regular S6. Don't mistake me. This is a very good smart phone. But there are some downsides to consider before getting swept up in the cool factor like I did. Probably deserves 4 stars but nobody reads those reviews.",M. Henson,Samsung_S6,431
60 of 66 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 10, 2015","Wow, what a difference a year makes. While last year's S5 took many steps in the right direction(being somewhat waterproof with better material and craftsmanship), it still wasn't there to make it a mouth-watering phone yet, like what HTC did when they first introduced their One M7, or whenever Apple introduces a new iPhone size. This year, Samsung has finally learned from both of their competitors, and made a phone that has all the good qualities of both, plus some of their own. Finally, this is the Galaxy S that you've always wanted and been dreaming of. * LOOKS/FORM-FACTOR/MATERIALS: The very first thing you notice when you handle the phone, is its new design and form factor - finally Samsung has completed their transformation of getting rid of all that ugly plastic parts. Now it is just all glass and metal, and now it is truly beautiful. The metal fully wraps around the edges ofthe phone. The back is beautiful, the sides are beautiful - heck, even the buttons are beautiful. It feels great in the hand, and oozes style and sophistication. The S6 Edge is just so unique-looking - it is the most beautiful phone I've seen in a long time. And contrary to what people might say or what you might think, the two sloped edges are not awkward to handle, does not dig into your skin, and is not uncomfortable to grip. * SCREEN: The very next thing you notice, of course, is the screen. I am continually pleasantly surprised at the evolution of Samsung's AMOLED technology - it has now became the best screen in the industry, hands down. I used to defend the LCD technology of the HTC M7, and at that point it was in fact overall superior to the Samsung S4 because the AMOLED then had issues in the sun, and color reproduction(it was too saturated and not natural). But now, they have fixed those issues, and the S6's screen is just quite simply the best. If you don't believe it, just compare an LG/Samsung OLED TV to any LED TVs today. I still think 5.1 inches for a screen of a PHONE is still too big, but overall, for what smartphones represent nowadays, it is acceptable - we have conditioned ourselves to accept the bigger sizes of smartphones(I remember when I first held a 4.2"" smartphone when it first came out - the HTC HD2 - and thought, ""what the h3ll is this monstrosity??""). * It doesn't hurt that Samsung boosted up the resolution to 1440 x 2560 pixels, which is approximately 577 ppi in pixel density. Although this is quite overkill right now, it's always nice to have the latest and greatest technology - that's the reason why we buy these overpriced phones in the first place, isn't it? It is also very bright, and sunlit legibility is excellent. Color reproduction is quite accurate, and like the S5, you can choose different color modes to suit your liking. *BATTERY LIFE: An important aspect to discuss is the battery life, now more than ever because there is no removable back cover to make replacing the battery easily like before, not to mention there is no microSD slot for you to add memory space to your phone. Comparatively, the S6 Edge is supposed to last a little less than the S6 regular, which I've read is less than last year's S5. But I'm one of those who are always around a charger, and I always carry external battery packs in my backpack when I travel, so that's never a concern. Seriously, who even buys an extra battery anymore - which you can only use for a single specific phone model - when your external battery can charge ANY and ALL phones and tablets?? This scenario only makes sense if your work is so demanding that you don't have extra time to charge the phone, and need to swap batteries IMMEDIATELY. I don't think that scenario is realistic nowadays when external batteries are so small, light, and cheap. My S6 goes from 100% at 10 am to about 20% at 10 pm with moderate use - so no complaints there. I get home, plug it up, and there are no issues. * What's better this year, is the wireless charging standards are already built into th",Johnny Amazon®,Samsung_S6,432

10 of 11 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on August 5, 2015","I don't know what some of these negative comments are talking about. No this isn't a scam, I received the g925F not the I (the F for international, the I for the India version. Although both have the EXACT same specs.) and the box doesn't have extra letters.... I must say, being a die hard iOS girl, that this is a nice phone. The screen is beautiful, it's android so you have to know it's not as simple (they have a toggle for a simpler version which I have yet to try), it's very presonisable. I was able to easily connect to my iPhone and transfer everything over, and when I say everything I mean everything! They matched my apps and if they didn't have the exact one they found one that was similer, freaking great option. Now for the people complain about battery life? WELCOME to the smart phone world, you wanted a mini TV screen that can multitask and be able to power a s*** ton of apps and keep up with what everyone is doing on facebook, twitter, myspace, tumbr and IG then yes the battery's suck. When you first get this phone you are going to sit there and program it to death, tweak everything to your liking. So the first week yeah your battery life is going to suck even more than normal. So androids I don't care which one has a s*** ton of apps that stay on in the back ground. So the apps with the screen saps your battery. So now you have two ways to fix this: a. Figure out to how to toggle all the apps from running in the background yourself which means you have to check up on them, or b. Download a app that does that exact thing for you such as juice defender or such like (no it doesn't turn off your fb no worries your gossip will come to you). Now with that being said the battery life and the way the phone is built has nothing to do with this seller. Why are you rating someone a horrible rate when it wasn't them who built the phone in their backyard? What you need to know when buying from this seller: * Crazy fast delivery, man got here super quick. * the phone was in it's box sealed and came with an American adapter for the charger. * the product works and works well. I bought it for cricket and works great. No damage. * Would I suggest you buy this phone coming from an iPhone? Yes! I like it, I definitely don't regret switching. * Would I suggest you buy it from this seller? Yes I gave the seller 5 stars.

The design of this phone is great looking (especially the gold platinum). The camera on it is the second best I've used on a phone. Only the LG G4 has a better camera IMO. This phone however does lack in other areas, and no its not the non-replaceable battery or lack of micro-sd support. According to Samsung ""Touchwiz"" has been toned down but it is still laggy!! Too much bloatware!! NO I don't want to use Samsung Hub, NO I don't want to use Samsung Music, NO I don't want to use Samsung Cloud!! YES I know loud music can damage my hearing (constantly comes up when adjusting vol up)!! Lastly, Why is Samsung not using Google's default AVRPC profile!! This causes a lot of headaches with MANY bluetooth devices including paring problems, missing song/artis info, and inability to use steering wheel controls for playback control!! Sorry Samsung, I had the S3, Note 2, Note 3, Note Edge (returned) and I can honestly say that I am a happy camper with my LG G4 I just received in exchanged for this device (cheaper too).",da_comittee,Samsung_S6,436

It looks amazing and the curved edge make it look very cool and unique, i had this phone ever since the day it came out and I enjoyed it very much. I had a screen protector and a heavy duty case to protect it from drops spills scraches anything. However the phone has a few BIG problems which I am going to talk about. 1. The phone is fragile. I had a case and a screen protector and I never dropped it, well until i did from about 3 feet and the bottom on the screen cracked. i couldn't believe that such a light fall would crack it, even though I had a Spigen case on it, and a screen protector. 2. Since it has a curved display, there are no real tempered glass screen protectors. 3. Battery life is average, and no removable battery which meant the phone has an expiration, unless you know or take it to someone who can change it for you. Even though these flaws are BIG to some people (like me) the phone is great, the camera is amazing, the speakers are very good, and the display is stunning, with that being said, after moving to the regular galaxy s6, I realized that its the better out of the two brothers. its more comfortable to use and is about 140$ cheaper too. take my advice if you are stuck between the s6 and the edge, don't go for the edge because the edges are more of a burden than something functional.",Mahmoud,Samsung_S6,437

It's an annoying step to have to take, but in fairness I'm much happier than I was when I wrote the review below and I'm adding a star as a result. Earlier: This phone is a total bust. It is often unbearably slow -- so much so that it's essentially unusable until a reboot. Rebooting is easier said than done when it's in super slow mode. Whatever software or memory glitch is to blame (according to the buzz online), it wasn't fixed in the latest update. The screen is also a problem. It doesn't always register touches. Another glitch: Several times the phone has dialed the wrong person. I click on one name, and someone else entirely from my phonebook gets a call from me. That's pretty awkward. I'll stand up for the curved screen, though. Reviewers say it's useless. So are high heels, but they look great. Same thing with this phone. Also, the camera is pretty great. Avoid this like the plague until they fix the slow problem.",Peter Scheer,Samsung_S6,439

You either need to carry an adapter with you all the time or spend another $15-$50 to buy an OEM/Original Samsung Travel Charger. This is the first time I bought an electronic device from amazon.com with a non-compatible charger in North America. I love the phone and I would give it 5 stars. I had been iPhone user since iPhone 3G. But I returned my iphone 6 and got a s6 edge. I love the design, the feel and the features.",Amazon Customer,Samsung_S6,440
3 of 4 people found the following review helpful,4,,"on June 26, 2015","first of all , I love this phone , it best samsung phone ever build yet, at least I think so... good: 1. What I really like about the phone is performance - it is super fast , smooth no lags at all - maybe I just got lucky and got perfect phone 2. Camera - the best camera that I ever used - much beter than my older s5 camera , my iphone 5 or brothers iphone 6 - its just simply best phone camera on the market taking perfect pictures even at night... (IMHO) 3. Design - love it , if you will take a gold S6 edge in your hands you will love it too... 4. wireless charging is great feature - needs to be perfected yet though 5. android 5.0.2 on s6 edge is a lot better than 4.4 on s5 - long story Now the bad part 1. display is not that great like reviews says , it has green tint and really dim compare to my old iphone 5 - i know that brightness needs to be all the way up with auto off , but it still really dim . I got phone from local store , I had to exchange it 5 times before I got one with somewhat acceptable display( still has some green tint with pink tint on bottom but oh well it the best one that they had...). don't get me wrong , colors are great on phone , blacks are deep , but take iphone 6 in store and galaxy s6 edge and compare white colors on both displays and you will notice difference right away - iphone has brighter display with more real white colors. Oh , and Galaxy S6 non edge version is even worst... 2. battery life is horible - I thought my s 5 battery was bad cause it was lasting only from 7am till 5pm on medium-heavy use - well s6 edge battery last from 7am ti 4 pm on light use - and when i use it heavely it lasting only 6-7 hours! 3. easy to scratch the sides and top - metal is pretty soft 4. super sensitive back button - really anoing 5. wireless charging is slow and phone getting pretty hot when using it 6. switching between 4g , lte and 3g is really slow - not good for traveling 7. not that great cellular signal - it is not bad but not good either - just ok overall I love the phone and would recommend to anyone than not expecting to have perfect phone and will be willing to sacrifice some functionality for nice design I would give it 4.5 stars out of 5",kerktam,Samsung_S6,441
1 of 1 people found the following review helpful,4,,"on May 22, 2015",No extendable memory? No big deal just move photos etc when needed. I recently extended the memory in my old phone and it did start slowing down. No removable battery? When the battery died in my old s2 it still took me 2 days to find someone who still stocked it. Storm in a teacup. Great display. Very fast. Pleasure to use. Miss the auto complete when typing with the default keyboard but maybe i am missing a cfg somewhere. Hardware is great but still getting used to lollipop. Oh and the battery life? I turn off wifi when i am out of the house and it was still in the 70s after nearly 12 hrs of light use. Much better than my s2 battery. I have fitness trackers running and just use the internet and whatsapp during the day. 4.5 stars after owning for almost a week.,tooktheredpill,Samsung_S6,442

But it is a classy and powerful device with lots to offer. Its is strong and durable with Gorilla glass and hard to break unless you want to. Definitely get a cover with nice protection, just in case.

The finger print scanner is not even close to what you would find on an iPhone; it works less than half the time. The biggest issue that I had was the battery. The battery has to be the worst that I've ever used. I considered getting a portable phone charger and keeping the phone, but in the end I decided that if I'm paying for a premium product then it should work like one. I ended up getting the iPhone 6 plus. The camera on the iPhone is garbage compared to the Galaxy Edge but at least my battery lasts longer than half a day.",JustinR,Samsung_S6,444

,5,,"on September 19, 2015","One of the better phones I've owned. I recently switched to T-mobile due to the nickel and diming scheme that Verizon pulls. I get great coverage on this phone, which is more than could be said about the IP6 that I originally had chosen (and returned) with T-mobile. This phone is one of the better phones I've owned because it actually allows me the freedom to do what I want to do on a phone. I have never had many personalizing items on any phone as I do on this one. The iPhone STILL doesn't have an IR blaster which is something that I cannot believe, after 7+ years, that phone is still not right. The edge design as well as the color got me interested in this phone. I like to buy unique items, and this phone fits the bill in the color respect and the ""edge"" respect. There is a display for the time and notifications in grayscale on the corner of the screen, which conserves battery, and also allows you to know exactly what you need to know without waking the phone. You can use the side for alerts and not take up any valuable screen size while playing games, or videos, and actually still be aware of your surroundings (if you get a text that is important, etc), and still be doing what you were initially doing. The battery life, despite hearing from reviews is bad, is actually about the same as the NOTE4 that I used to own. It's rumored it's the same battery, just inside of the phone, but I don't really want to dissect my phone to find out, lol. Navigation with Google is actually much better than Apple maps, it displays the exit sign that you will need to get off at if traveling on a highway, so that way you know exactly where you're going, almost mirrored to the Garmin GPS that I had used previously. I was worried about the coverage initially with the issues that I'd had with my iPhone, but this is a band 12 supported phone (IP6S is as well), allowing for it to work automatically on other carriers when signal isn't as good with T-mobile. That and the cost of the phone + plan is worth much more than what Verizon had to offer. The camera is EXCELLENT on this phone, as is the sound quality. The screen is vibrant and large, bright, and doesn't make the battery deplete substantially. The phone runs hot at times due to it's metal structure, but it's not extremely noticeable, more so if you have location turned on.",NARNTEK3049,Samsung_S6,449
,1,,"on September 15, 2015","The big draw of the curved screen is supposedly to get notification flashes even when the screen is face down. The solution to this ""problem"" that doesn't require an unnecessary phone just to be a walking marketing ploy for selling new phones to people with perfectly good ones is simple: don't put your darn phone face down. What a concept. You can use the ""edge screen"" to see extra tidbits of info along the side... what is this, a CNN rolling news bar? Or even better, the existing notifications bar that drops down from the top? What a completely worthless, redundant thing to create. I can't even call it a feature, a feature is something I would have to be able to use practically. You can turn both of these ""features"" off, and once you do it makes having this phone fundamentally worthless. The Edge is difficult to grip because of the screen curves. The power button is in an inconvenient spot toward the middle of the phone, right where a palm or finger holding it would be, leading to nothing but annoying pushes in the middle of use. The internal lighting isn't enough to overcome the curve of the phone, so there are constant visible shadows (or glare, depending on your lighting) down the length of both sides of the screen. So on either side of photos, videos, and fullscreen activities you don't get true color display, there's a built-in shadow caused by the design of the phone REGARDLESS of what angle you hold the phone at. The screen is curved but the keyboard and display are not, so you have an awkward rounded space to click on a flat display item - especially problematic while using the keyboard with its tiny keys. And in terms of useless starter apps, this Galaxy is the most gut-loaded with junk by far. It even came with instagram, so you can partake in the commodification of culture straight out of the package! Most irritating of all and by far what makes me loathe this phone the most is: this glorified flashlight is literally impossible for me to use. The screen being 3D and not flat gives it a sort of 3D-within-3D appearance like some kind of sci-fi haptic hologram (or, for a different visual, like a backlit layer of spilled koolaid). My eyes don't know what the heck to do with it! So using this phone not only messes with my depth perception (aka ruins it) but gives me motion sickness when I sidescroll. I was pressured into getting this phone by a retail associate at my carrier. Between that and its terrible ill-conceived design, it's clear to me that it only exists for the sake of being a new phone to draw in people who need to have the newest phone at all times. If I could give this review zero stars, I would. I was going to really try and make this phone work, to give myself some time to get used to it, but it's so unusable that it's not even worth it.",Rollingjules,Samsung_S6,450
,2,,"on July 17, 2015","My first ever Android device came in the form of Samsung's Galaxy s3. In my opinion the S3 , to this date, is by the far the best phone I have ever owned. I have patiently waited for Samsung to release a phone that can bring me the same joy and wonder as the S3 and even going past my issue with Large form factor I thought the S6 would be it! However, I was sorely wrong. The S6 is a failure in my eyes. I feel that Samsung was pressured to move away from it's plastic to a more premium feel and didn't think about the internals or software. I waited so long to join the android world due to this one thought, "" Over powered, under performing"". This statement equates to the S6. On paper the S6 should be a powerhouse. Unfortunately that is quite the opposite. The S6, when it works, does blow you away. However, it doesn't work efficiently all the time. Even with using a different launcher and avoiding touchwiz the phone lags beyond belief. The experience is maddening. To top it off the phone will get so hot that the metal will actually burn you. Please note, this is not an exaggeration and also not while phone is on the charger. The phone had a recent update which admittedly helped some of the lag, but it has gone back to its old ways of being close to useless. Random battery drains, lag, and overheating are the name of the game with this phone. The edge screen is aesthetically pleasing but serves no function. Build quality is good. That is about it. Please take your time before investing in this phone. I am currently in the process of trying to sell mine. The phone I can recommend is the Galaxy Alpha- it is discontinued so if you are ok with a device that won't have support or accessories it has a smaller form factor and works correctly.",Michael Neel,Samsung_S6,451

,5,,"on September 3, 2015","Wow, what a difference a year makes. While last year's S5 took many steps in the right direction(being somewhat waterproof with better material and craftsmanship), it still wasn't there to make it a mouth-watering phone yet, like what HTC did when they first introduced their One M7, or whenever Apple introduces a new iPhone size. This year, Samsung has finally learned from both of their competitors, and made a phone that has all the good qualities of both, plus some of their own. Finally, this is the Galaxy S that you've always wanted and been dreaming of. * LOOKS/FORM-FACTOR/MATERIALS: The very first thing you notice when you handle the phone, is its new design and form factor - finally Samsung has completed their transformation of getting rid of all that ugly plastic parts. Now it is just all glass and metal, and now it is truly beautiful. The metal fully wraps around the edges ofthe phone.

Not a lie. Battery life best: 1 day 5 hrs moderate use, Great. I knew that I was leaving vanilla Android (Moto G LTE), but I didn't know I'd miss it so much; and if I could install it on the S6, I would. Touchwiz isn't so bad though. Over all, through iPhones, Galaxys (or is it Galaxies?), HTCs and Moto, the S6 edge gold, by spec and OS and design is the best phone I've owned. I had a user error issue where I thought the fingerprint scnner was not working but I made a better impression of my finger and its perfect.

That is why it is even cheaper than the s6 flat. It works with more bands than the US version (G925I), so you can use it almost everywhere in the planet. You will only have to change the date and time settings and buy a US charger, everything else is the same than the US and Latinamerican version.

5 of 8 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 27, 2015","Samsung has done a better job with the Galaxy S6 Edge than with the S5. Not only is it beautiful and light, the screen resolution is better than ever. To begin with the body - it is slim and a lightweight all-metal body with a curved glass design that is lightning-fast thanks to the Samsung Exynos® 7420 Octa-core 64-bit processor that delivers the most power and speed I've ever had in a smartphone. Samsung increased the fast charge capability and the Galaxy S6 Edge charges much faster that other smart phones. Samsung has also paid attention to the camera and it is significantly improved. With both a front facing (the all important Selfie feature) and a rear facing camera option that you will love. You will also love that you can quickly launch the camera by double tapping the Home button and use optical image stabilization to eliminate blurry photos and shaky videos. No more blurry selfies taken by your kids to be posted on social media. There is a feature to disable the quick launch of your camera, if you dislike that feature. Samsung has added a larger aperture to the camera for low-light photography and an infrared sensor to improve white balance. Overall the camera takes great pictures and if one of your criteria for a smart phone is taking good pictures, then the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge is for you. As with any improvement in technology, the cost goes up and without a doubt the Galaxy S6 Edge does have improved processing and a better camera, but it also comes with a higher cost and only you can determine if the additional features are for you.",Lynne Ober,Samsung_S6,462

I wasn't sure how i was going to test the phone to make sure it is unlocked till I found out it uses a nano chip now instead a macro. This was perfect because I have an iphone so I was able to use my sim card from Jamaica to test it out and It worked: texting and calling without wifi and then the wifi worked well on it's own with the data service off. I don't know much about the Samsung's Galaxy but I was able to move around apps and the home screen pretty easily. I don't know if the feature on the top right of the screen for speed dial was always there but I liked that feature. He will be happpy when he gets his new ""toy"" . The camera works well too! One thing to mention is that I found it odd that the Samsung seal on the box was broken but the company selling this said this was their doing to ensure the adapter that came with it was in fact from Europe. And to make sure all the components were in there. It was nice of them to give me a Type A plug( the ones used in the US and other parts of the Western Hemisphere) When he get's the phone I will update my review if he has anything to add.",tduany,Samsung_S6,513

As a disclaimer I am going to mention that I have never broken a screen and have owned multiple phones up to now. The screen broke yesterday while in my pocket. It broke because I was reaching over a counter. The entire screen cracked in a spider fasion. I cannot believe that a phone that is marketed to be so great broke while in my pocket. I called Samsung and they were no help. I recommend do not buy this phone. I will not be buying another Samsung product because I cannot afford to pay $800 for a phone that will break while in my pocket.,Pen Name,Samsung_S6,515

0 of 1 people found the following review helpful,3,,"on July 15, 2015","Aesthetically, this is a great looking phone. The best looking phone currently, better looking than any iPhone. The screen quality is also phenomenal. However, I absolutely hate the software. This is my first Samsung Galaxy phone, and supposedly, the S6 has a less obtrusive touchwhiz software compared to older galaxy phones. I'm coming from various Nexus phones, so I used to the vanilla-ness and snappiness of the Nexus phones. I now understand the touchwhiz hate. This biggest problem with the touchwhiz on S6 edge is lag. The lag is absolutely excruciating, and the initial lag on the lock screen is so awful. I have issues putting in the 4 pins to unlock this phone because the lag is so bad. After the phone unlocks, it takes awhile for the phone to get going. Occasionally, if you open an app to quickly after unlocking the phone, there could be a 30 second freeze. If you have music going while unlocking the phone, lag can potentially go on for eternity. Once the phone is up and running, it does run smooth. As for the Samsung apps themselves, my thoughts are 'meh'. I don't hate them, but I disabled what I could. I sort of like the S health which counts my steps. Cyanogenmod folks have yet to crack this phone because of the proprietary chip exynos. If I can get another OS on this phone, such as vanilla android or cyanogenmod, I would do it in a heartbeat. As for the battery, it's about average. The Nexus phones were about average for battery as well, so no real change. I do think the S6 edge is slightly worse though, but I think lots of the battery issues are due to TouchWhiz. Even with non-use, I can feel the phone getting hot in my pocket, and I'm sure the Samsung apps are just going crazy in the background. I don't take lots of pictures with my phone, but the camera is top notch. Maybe I would love this phone more, if I took more picture. tl;dr Looks and the aesthetics: 5 stars, This phone is currently the best looking phone. Software: 1 star, I absolutely loathe TouchWhiz and the lag. Battery: 3 stars, The battery life is average Camera: 5 stars Overall: A little bit more than 3 stars.",BevoChan,Samsung_S6,517

I could not find the low light setting in the camera app. I did not see the manual exposure feature in the camera app unlike ASUS Zenfone 2's camera app. But the picture quality consistently outperforms iPHone 6+'s and Intermittently outperforms ASUS Zenfone 2's. Entering the gallery app still lags 3 seconds. The 2nd entry lags 1 second. That's the worst part. There were less than 200 pictures. The entering speed is slower than Moto G 2015's or iPHone 6's. That's the worse defect in the phone. Powerful Android features outperforms iPhone 6 or 6+'s iOS 8.4. The Android OS has more than twice number of line of code than iOS. It's a complex beast with outstanding multi threading performance. I heard that iOS 8.4 does not support true multi threading in user space apps. That's a joke for the world's most valuable company by market capital. So long iPHone 6 are better for armatures.,Hil,Samsung_S6,528

While the screen is great and it takes excellent photos, the battery life is awful and the UI is unresponsive and flaky. At best, under typical use (texting, web browsing, a few photos) you'll get about 5 hours of battery before needing recharge. Fast Charging is kind of a joke if you have to do it every few hours. Touch response is awful - it can take several taps to get an app to actually launch, and once launched is similarly frustrating to actually use an app. On the other hand, the response on the edge is overactive, so just by holding the phone you'll find yourself accidentally triggering app launches and buttons presses.",John Brecht,Samsung_S6,594

379 of 391 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 10, 2015","I got a chance to test a Galaxy S6 out and immediately bought one for my wife. I'm a complete phone nerd (XDA Developers Recognized Contributor, if that means anything to you) so I massively over analyze these things. It's a VERY nice phone but it's got some things that I consider drawbacks. For my wife, all the drawbacks listed below were non issues. She didn't care about these issues. So understand that my 'drawbacks' are completely subjective to your personal needs. But they are things that you should be aware of and consider if they mean anything to you before purchasing. ?????THE UPSIDES????? ? The screen is incredible. Like really incredible. The resolution is better than my eye can see. I use a Galaxy S4 as my regular phone and it has great resolution where you can't see individual pixels. I thought the S4 screen was as good as you can get, but the S6 screen takes it to a whole new level. Even though you can't see pixels on either screen, the higher resolution of the S6 screen makes everything look so sharp that it's nearly impossible to tell you are looking at a screen. It's that incredible. ? The design of the phone just feels more 'expensive'. I mean that in a good way. It feels just higher quality than previous models in the Galaxy S line. The S3 and S4 for example are often critiqued for having a plastic shell. The S6 has a metal band around the outside that just makes it feel 'premium' in your hand. It should also provide more protection for the device as well. ? TouchWiz is HEAVILY scaled back. I hate TouchWiz (Samsung's version of Android) It adds a layer of UI that is neither helpful nor intuitive. And it's a resource hog which slows the phone down for important tasks just so it can make the scrolling smoother, and other such useless tradeoffs. On the S6 TouchWiz was barely noticeable. The UI looks more like the standard Google Android Lollipop interface. It was all just much smoother and simpler and better and wonderful. ? Camera. 16 MP. And the images it takes look stunning on the super HD screen. Those photos on a larger high resolution monitor are simply stunning. ?????THE DOWNSIDES????? ? The battery is not removable or easily replaceable. A cell phone battery has a life of about 500 charge cycles. I tend to keep my phones for 2 years as daily users, then I keep my old phones for a variety of other purposes around the house. (My old HTC Sensation is hooked up to my stereo for use as a nice wifi streaming media player with a touchscreen UI, for example) I eventually have a need to replace batteries because I wear them out. I like being able to go on Amazon, spent $20 on a replacement battery, pop it in and be done. Additionally, even if you don't keep your phones that long, batteries fail sometimes. The stock batteries on the Galaxy S4 had some problems. They were minimal, but for those affected the battery absolutely had to be replaced. On the S4 it took 8 seconds and the problem was solved. On the S6 I'm sure it would be covered by warranty but it'd be a pain to take it somewhere to have it worked on should the issue come up. So no replaceable battery is a deal killer for me. This might not be an issue for you. If not, great! But be aware of the issue before making purchase decisions. ? You can't expand the storage with an SD Card. I don't want to live in the cloud. I hate the cloud. Sometimes I'm not on an LTE network. Sometimes I'm in the middle of nowhere but still want to show someone pictures of my kids. I got my wife the 32GB model. That sounds like a lot, but keep in mind that some of that is dedicated for the operating system and user apps. So you don't get to use all 32GB. The S6 is going to be available in up to 128GB, which ends my problem with not liking the cloud option. Again, you might not care. If not, great! My wife doesn't keep a lot of stuff on her phone. She moves all her pictures to her computer and never loaded video to watch on her phone, so the storage thing wasn't a big deal to he",Obi Wan,Samsung_S6,618

I was hoping for the blue only to find out that it's not available in the U.S. The black isn't a true black, the edge was $100 more for features I really could care less about. I didn't need any confusion. I'm not very good at adjusting to different phones, and I just found this to be very smooth and easy to adjust to. I love this phone! The only thing I really don't like is the amount of finger prints you can see. I got the Samsung wireless charger, I love that as well! **** There are some complaints about the phone battery, I was very annoyed at first about it as well. I thought I was going to have to keep recharging. I have not had a problem with the phone not lasting through the day on average days. I do not do any gaming, just surfing, my 2 year old sometimes watches Youtube, I facebook, both my email accounts are on my phone so I get frequent notices. I would still highly recommend this phone, and I still love it.",Karin O,Samsung_S6,619

As a result, the Galaxy S6 is the best smartphone any person can currently. My review will focus on 3 key aspects: exterior design and materials, tech specs and hardware performance, and interface and ui. I will also point out outstanding and new features along the way. Exterior Design: Although at first the Galaxy S6 may not look completely different from the Galaxy S5, it is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor. The 2 sheets of Gorilla Glass 4 adorning the front and back make the phone feel extremely premium, resolving common complaint about the previous generation. It has a full metal band surrounding it, rather than a faux plastic one. Now, the feel in hand is comparable to the iPhone 6, and the design is elegant while familiar. The Black Sapphire color on the back shimmers beautifully in the light, changing into an almost purple/dark blue shade. Since the phone is so thin at 6.8 mm, the camera module protrudes slightly from the chassis, however it does not affect the phone. There is a sapphire lens to protect the camera, but placing the phone in a case should alleviate the protruding camera issue. Going to the front. there is a typical rectangular home button with a recent apps capacitive key on the left, with a back key on the right. Overall, the Galaxy S6 is the best phone Samsung has ever designed; however, the sealed battery and absence of a micro SD card slot may upset many. I do not replace the batteries in my phone nor add SD cards for storage, but customers from the Galaxy devices before may be unhappy. Tech Specs, Hardware Performance, Notable Features: The Galaxy in real life and on paper is a monster! Screen: It packs an amazing 5.1 Super AMOLED screen with a resolution of 2560x1440. The screen is capable of bright whites and dark blacks, and is the best mobile display currently on the market. Although Super AMOLED screens tend to have overly saturated colors, choosing AMOLED Cinema mode in settings creates natural colors. Fingerprint Scanner: Instead of a swipe based sensor, the new fingerprint scanner embedded in the home button is a capacitive touch based sensor, like the one on the iPhone 6. All you do is place your finger on the home button to unlock the phone. You can set up a total of 4 fingers, and the sensor is extremely reliable and useful. Every person using this phone should have the fingerprint sensor turned on since it provides good security while being intuitive to use. Camera: The camera is a 16 megapixel sensor with OIS. The Galaxy S6 has the best camera out of all Android phones, and easily competes with the iPhone 6 Plus. Because of the higher resolution, images are extremely detailed. The Optical Imaging Stabilization ensures pictures are clear, while videos are buttery smooth. The OIS also helps at night, as the sensor can pull in more light without creating a blurry image. The result is an amazing camera that can produce vibrant and beautiful pictures during the day, and a camera that can create accurate and bright pictures at night. The camera is also capable of 4K video recording, and slow motion video as well. An important new feature the Galaxy S6 incorporates is the double click on home button to activate. When you double click the home button, it opens the camera in less than 1 second! The ""just shoot"" mentality this camera gives its users is simply amazing and unmatched. For the pro users out there, the camera includes a professional mode that users can use to adjust ISO, white balance, and more settings. The front camera is 5 megapixels, and it is a strong front facing camera. Not much can be said about it, but it produces beautiful selfies and good colors, and is more than adequate for all users. Quick Charging and Wireless Charging: The Galaxy S6 is capable of adaptive quick charging using the charger supplied in the box. This charges the Galaxy S6 extremely fast; you can get about 4 hours of use ",blublue,Samsung_S6,620

I'm a complete phone nerd (XDA Developers Recognized Contributor, if that means anything to you) so I massively over analyze these things. It's a VERY nice phone but it's got some things that I consider drawbacks. For my wife, all the drawbacks listed below were non issues. She didn't care about these issues. So understand that my 'drawbacks' are completely subjective to your personal needs. But they are things that you should be aware of and consider if they mean anything to you before purchasing. ?????THE UPSIDES????? ? The screen is incredible. Like really incredible. The resolution is better than my eye can see. I use a Galaxy S4 as my regular phone and it has great resolution where you can't see individual pixels. I thought the S4 screen was as good as you can get, but the S6 screen takes it to a whole new level. Even though you can't see pixels on either screen, the higher resolution of the S6 screen makes everything look so sharp that it's nearly impossible to tell you are looking at a screen. It's that incredible. ? The design of the phone just feels more 'expensive'. I mean that in a good way. It feels just higher quality than previous models in the Galaxy S line. The S3 and S4 for example are often critiqued for having a plastic shell. The S6 has a metal band around the outside that just makes it feel 'premium' in your hand. It should also provide more protection for the device as well. ? TouchWiz is HEAVILY scaled back. I hate TouchWiz (Samsung's version of Android) It adds a layer of UI that is neither helpful nor intuitive. And it's a resource hog which slows the phone down for important tasks just so it can make the scrolling smoother, and other such useless tradeoffs. On the S6 TouchWiz was barely noticeable. The UI looks more like the standard Google Android Lollipop interface. It was all just much smoother and simpler and better and wonderful. ? Camera. 16 MP. And the images it takes look stunning on the super HD screen. Those photos on a larger high resolution monitor are simply stunning. ?????THE DOWNSIDES????? ? The battery is not removable or easily replaceable. A cell phone battery has a life of about 500 charge cycles. I tend to keep my phones for 2 years as daily users, then I keep my old phones for a variety of other purposes around the house. (My old HTC Sensation is hooked up to my stereo for use as a nice wifi streaming media player with a touchscreen UI, for example) I eventually have a need to replace batteries because I wear them out. I like being able to go on Amazon, spent $20 on a replacement battery, pop it in and be done. Additionally, even if you don't keep your phones that long, batteries fail sometimes. The stock batteries on the Galaxy S4 had some problems. They were minimal, but for those affected the battery absolutely had to be replaced. On the S4 it took 8 seconds and the problem was solved. On the S6 I'm sure it would be covered by warranty but it'd be a pain to take it somewhere to have it worked on should the issue come up. So no replaceable battery is a deal killer for me. This might not be an issue for you. If not, great! But be aware of the issue before making purchase decisions. ? You can't expand the storage with an SD Card. I don't want to live in the cloud. I hate the cloud. Sometimes I'm not on an LTE network. Sometimes I'm in the middle of nowhere but still want to show someone pictures of my kids. I got my wife the 32GB model. That sounds like a lot, but keep in mind that some of that is dedicated for the operating system and user apps. So you don't get to use all 32GB. The S6 is going to be available in up to 128GB, which ends my problem with not liking the cloud option. Again, you might not care. If not, great! My wife doesn't keep a lot of stuff on her phone. She moves all her pictures to her computer and never loaded video to watch on her phone, so the storage thing wasn't a big deal to he",Obi Wan,Samsung_S6,621

I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. Samsung Galaxy S6 tries to be a revolutionary, but it is evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. So do check local specs. I played around with both S6 and S6 Edge for few days and my opinions are based on this. There are tons of reviews going into lot of details, so I am focused on few other aspects like what’s out there and how to compare specs. First Big Changes: No microSD or removable battery. I know many of you loyal Samsung fans says BUMMER! I was a die hard fan of Samsung till S4, then I went to LG G2/G3. I think this is the best bet for S6 to pull it off after a dismal year for Samsung last year. I was very curious to try out S6 and HTC One M9 as they are most talked about now. Many manufacturers are going away from microSD card slots and this is absolutely a must and is a key differentiator from iPhone. I am really sad Samsung decided to drop microSD card slot as well as no removable battery. Why?! Screen is a beauty on S6 – Just Gorgeous. Just go to a retail store and feel it! The Edge feature is still gimmicky. Unlike Note Edge, this has both sides so less dorky but still I am not sold yet. Unless you have loads of money, I will shy away from it for one more year and get it next year when they polish it up. It is certainly fancy and nice to show off, but I would rather buy an Android wear watch like Motorola 360 or Samsung Gear or LG R series. I like Motorola 360 but waiting for version 2 to appear. I like Round watches. IF YOU HAVE LAST YEAR model of any phone, PLEASE DON’T upgrade. Phones are becoming so standard and power packed it makes no sense to upgrade and waste money every year. I buy and sell so many phones as it is like a hobby for me, but I stick to one phone as primary for couple of years now. My main requirements are a 128 GB microSD, good screen, battery life and performance. I am trying hard to see if I can live without one. S6 and S6 Edge comes in a 128 GB variant and I will wait for prices to stabilize on this model. In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size, weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don’t advertise or mention SAR prominently. phone parameters: {size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR rating} Samsung Galaxy S6: 5.65 x 2.78 x 0.27 in, 138 gm, 1440 x 2560 pixels, 5.1 in, 577 ppi, 3 GB RAM, NO MICROSD SLOT (bummer), Internal Storage upto 128 GB, Exynos 7420 Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2.1 GHz Cortex-A57, Gorilla Glass 4, 16 MP/5MP camera, SAR 1.15 W/kg (head), 1.16 W/kg (body) NANO SIM Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge: Slightly lower dimensions, 0.01 in thicker, 6 gm less weight, Same resolution, Curved Screen, HTC One M9: 5.69 x 2.74 x 0.38 in, 157 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 3 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 20.7 MP (rear), 4 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 810, Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2 GHz Cortex-A57 Samsung Galaxy S5: 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 in, 145 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.1 in, 432 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, MSM8974-AC Processor: Quad core, 2500 MHz, Krait 400, 0.63 W/kg (head), 0.82 W/kg (body) HTC One M8: 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 in, 160 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 4 MP (rear), 5 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, Quad core, 2300 MHz, Krait 400, 0.94 W/kg (head), 0.83 W/kg (body) LG G3: 5.76 x 2.94 x 0.35 in, 149 gm, 2560 x 1440 pixels, 5.5 in, 538 pp",rpv,Samsung_S6,622

Works great under direct sun light too. It's fast, very responsive. Call quality is excellent Finger print unlock features works very well. Much better than the S5 CONS: It's slippery - my wife dropped her 4 times the first day she got hers. Yikes. But it didn't break! I got her a case now...

10 of 10 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 10, 2015","Wow, what a difference a year makes. While last year's S5 took many steps in the right direction(being somewhat waterproof with better material and craftsmanship), it still wasn't there to make it a mouth-watering phone yet, like what HTC did when they first introduced their One M7, or whenever Apple introduces a new iPhone size. This year, Samsung has finally learned from both of their competitors, and made a phone that has all the good qualities of both, plus some of their own. Finally, this is the Galaxy S that you've always wanted and been dreaming of. * LOOKS/FORM-FACTOR/MATERIALS: The very first thing you notice when you handle the phone, is its new design and form factor - finally Samsung has completed their transformation of getting rid of all that ugly plastic parts. Now it is just all glass and metal, and now it is truly beautiful. The metal fully wraps around the edges ofthe phone. The back is beautiful, the sides are beautiful - heck, even the buttons are beautiful. It feels great in the hand, and oozes style and sophistication. * SCREEN: The very next thing you notice, of course, is the screen. I am continually pleasantly surprised at the evolution of Samsung's AMOLED technology - it has now became the best screen in the industry, hands down. I used to defend the LCD technology of the HTC M7, and at that point it was in fact overall superior to the Samsung S4 because the AMOLED then had issues in the sun, and color reproduction(it was too saturated and not natural). But now, they have fixed those issues, and the S6's screen is just quite simply the best. If you don't believe it, just compare an LG/Samsung OLED TV to any LED TVs today. I still think 5.1 inches for a screen of a PHONE is still too big, but overall, for what smartphones represent nowadays, it is acceptable - we have conditioned ourselves to accept the bigger sizes of smartphones(I remember when I first held a 4.2"" smartphone when it first came out - the HTC HD2 - and thought, ""what the h3ll is this monstrosity??""). * It doesn't hurt that Samsung boosted up the resolution to 1440 x 2560 pixels, which is approximately 577 ppi in pixel density. Although this is quite overkill right now, it's always nice to have the latest and greatest technology - that's the reason why we buy these overpriced phones in the first place, isn't it? It is also very bright, and sunlit legibility is excellent. Color reproduction is quite accurate, and like the S5, you can choose different color modes to suit your liking. *BATTERY LIFE: An important aspect to discuss is the battery life, now more than ever because there is no removable back cover to make replacing the battery easily like before, not to mention there is no microSD slot for you to add memory space to your phone. Comparatively, the S6 Edge is supposed to last a little less than the S6 regular, which I've read is less than last year's S5. But I'm one of those who are always around a charger, and I always carry external battery packs in my backpack when I travel, so that's never a concern. Seriously, who even buys an extra battery anymore - which you can only use for a single specific phone model - when your external battery can charge ANY and ALL phones and tablets?? This scenario only makes sense if your work is so demanding that you don't have extra time to charge the phone, and need to swap batteries IMMEDIATELY. I don't think that scenario is realistic nowadays when external batteries are so small, light, and cheap. My S6 goes from 100% at 10 am to about 20% at 10 pm with moderate use - so no complaints there. I get home, plug it up, and there are no issues. * What's better this year, is the wireless charging standards are already built into the phone, so you can just buy a charging pad for about $50 and feel even more cool. * USER INTERFACE/SOFTWARE: The Samsung user interface called TouchWiz used to be bloated and sluggish. It would slow down(navigating throughout the phone, switching between apps, and using",Johnny Amazon®,Samsung_S6,624
13 of 14 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 10, 2015","For readers, my opinions on this device (ATT 32Gb version) is based off the experiences I had with this device for the passed few hours as today is launch day (April 10, 2015). I will continue to update this review in the future. This review should be the similar to Galaxy S6 on other carriers such as Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile. Pros: - No more plastics and cheap material. Samsung is finally giving us the hardware that we've long desired. By far, the best designed Galaxy phone to date imo - 5.1 in, QHD Super AMOLED screen. The screen is absolutely gorgeous that it hurts my eyes a bit. I'm still adjusting to it. - 16MP Camera with Smart OIS and 5MP front camera. Very well specs, but even better in performance. In short, the best camera on any android phones. I cannot believe that the picture came out so well in low light environment. You have to try it yourself to believe how great these low light pictures come out. - Gorilla Glass 4 panels for front and back (reminds me of the iPhone 4 and Nexus 4). Gorilla Glass are known to be tough and scratch resistance. - Comes in various colors: White, black, gold, green, blue (US only get the white, black, and gold unfortunately) - Comes in 32, 64, or 128GB of built-in memory. (For the 32gb - 3.7gb is for system partition, 25.2 for data/apps/pictures) - Less of the TouchWiz’s gimmicky features like the eye scroll, eye away from the screen pause. So we will not be experiencing the same slowdown or low storage as we did with earlier versions. If the GS4/5 were all about the features, this phone is all about the design. I do like the camera app and how they add a ""close all"" into the recent screen. - Rapid charging (need to use this more to confirm their claim of 4hrs of battery in 10 minute charge - UPDATED 5/1/15 i am getting about 1 to 1 1/2 hrs of use after the 10 minute charge, I'm guessing the 4hr claim is idle??) - Wireless charging - So if you have extra money that you want to drop for a wireless charging dock, you will be able to use it with this phone. Cons (Not necessarily apply to everyone): - No removable back panel. - No removable battery. I’m a battery hog, so I’m always draining my battery by 3-4pm. Not being able to just swap out my battery will be a pain, but let’s wait to see if the battery swap will be needed in a month when I fully test this device. - Lower battery capacity - 2550mAh compared to the 2600mAh in GS4 and 2800mAh in GS5. With the new processor, battery usage should be more efficient so it should not be a big deal, but end-users would rather the capacity to increase than decrease (Will update if this make through a day of normal usage, UPDATED 5/1/15 - I'm getting average about 8-9 hrs of normal usage, not ideal but I'll manage) - No waterproofing like the GS5, but I never used a smartphone that was waterproofed before, so not a big issue ""to me"" - No ability to swap out memory card – Might bother some Galaxy fans, but with the higher memory options, I do not think this is a huge problem. - Still no on-screen navigation button – Might only be a problem for ""pure"" Android fan. - Rear Camera and Flash sticks out a bit and not flush with the back panel. - Front and back glass is a potential problem as we all experiences with iPhone 4 and Nexus 4. Glass will break if you drop your phone at the right angle regardless how much stronger it is, so ""case up"". - The 1 speaker at the bottom is louder, however when you turn it on max, you will get some distortions in the audio quality. - There are some apps on there that I prefer downloading myself rather than them pushing it on me. There are some Social apps or Microsoft apps included such as OneDrive, facebook, etc. I personally use these apps, but there are people who don't. - I have been experiencing some weird stutters/lags while messing around the phone. This might because I'm loading a bunch of apps into it right now. I will need a few more days to look into this. Overall, this feels like a this is a solid de",FrozenCloud,Samsung_S6,625

The screen is fantastic. My monthly Google calendar shows up on 1 screen, and it's easy to read all the events on it. I can actually use the phone in bright sunlight, something I haven't been able to do well with prior cell phones. There was an Samsung push update which appears to have helped the battery life, and I for that reason have raised the rating from 3 to 4 stars. The battery now lasts me all day, with casual uses. If you are a heavy user, this phone will not last you all day without a re-charge by 2 PM. The good news is that a 10-15 minute recharge will give you a 30-40% or so battery boost and the phone can be >90% in about one hour. I still do not recommend the phone for heavy ap users (gamers). You'll need to consider the Samsung note or the Droid phones as I can't see the S6 lasting past 2 PM for those individuals.",walnut the dog,Samsung_S6,626

My main requirements are a 128 GB microSD, good screen, battery life and performance. I am trying hard to see if I can live without one. S6 and S6 Edge comes in a 128 GB variant and I will wait for prices to stabilize on this model. In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size, weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice.

While last year's S5 took many steps in the right direction(being somewhat waterproof with better material and craftsmanship), it still wasn't there to make it a mouth-watering phone yet, like what HTC did when they first introduced their One M7, or whenever Apple introduces a new iPhone size. This year, Samsung has finally learned from both of their competitors, and made a phone that has all the good qualities of both, plus some of their own. Finally, this is the Galaxy S that you've always wanted and been dreaming of. * LOOKS/FORM-FACTOR/MATERIALS: The very first thing you notice when you handle the phone, is its new design and form factor - finally Samsung has completed their transformation of getting rid of all that ugly plastic parts. Now it is just all glass and metal, and now it is truly beautiful. The metal fully wraps around the edges ofthe phone. The back is beautiful, the sides are beautiful - heck, even the buttons are beautiful. It feels great in the hand, and oozes style and sophistication. * SCREEN: The very next thing you notice, of course, is the screen. I am continually pleasantly surprised at the evolution of Samsung's AMOLED technology - it has now became the best screen in the industry, hands down. I used to defend the LCD technology of the HTC M7, and at that point it was in fact overall superior to the Samsung S4 because the AMOLED then had issues in the sun, and color reproduction(it was too saturated and not natural). But now, they have fixed those issues, and the S6's screen is just quite simply the best. If you don't believe it, just compare an LG/Samsung OLED TV to any LED TVs today. I still think 5.1 inches for a screen of a PHONE is still too big, but overall, for what smartphones represent nowadays, it is acceptable - we have conditioned ourselves to accept the bigger sizes of smartphones(I remember when I first held a 4.2"" smartphone when it first came out - the HTC HD2 - and thought, ""what the h3ll is this monstrosity??""). * It doesn't hurt that Samsung boosted up the resolution to 1440 x 2560 pixels, which is approximately 577 ppi in pixel density. Although this is quite overkill right now, it's always nice to have the latest and greatest technology - that's the reason why we buy these overpriced phones in the first place, isn't it? It is also very bright, and sunlit legibility is excellent. Color reproduction is quite accurate, and like the S5, you can choose different color modes to suit your liking. *BATTERY LIFE: An important aspect to discuss is the battery life, now more than ever because there is no removable back cover to make replacing the battery easily like before, not to mention there is no microSD slot for you to add memory space to your phone. Comparatively, the S6 Edge is supposed to last a little less than the S6 regular, which I've read is less than last year's S5. But I'm one of those who are always around a charger, and I always carry external battery packs in my backpack when I travel, so that's never a concern. Seriously, who even buys an extra battery anymore - which you can only use for a single specific phone model - when your external battery can charge ANY and ALL phones and tablets?? This scenario only makes sense if your work is so demanding that you don't have extra time to charge the phone, and need to swap batteries IMMEDIATELY. I don't think that scenario is realistic nowadays when external batteries are so small, light, and cheap. My S6 goes from 100% at 10 am to about 20% at 10 pm with moderate use - so no complaints there. I get home, plug it up, and there are no issues. * What's better this year, is the wireless charging standards are already built into the phone, so you can just buy a charging pad for about $50 and feel even more cool. * USER INTERFACE/SOFTWARE: The Samsung user interface called TouchWiz used to be bloated and sluggish. It would slow down(navigating throughout the phone, switching between apps, and using",Johnny Amazon®,Samsung_S6,629

As a result, the Galaxy S6 is the best smartphone any person can currently. My review will focus on 3 key aspects: exterior design and materials, tech specs and hardware performance, and interface and ui. I will also point out outstanding and new features along the way. Exterior Design: Although at first the Galaxy S6 may not look completely different from the Galaxy S5, it is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor. The 2 sheets of Gorilla Glass 4 adorning the front and back make the phone feel extremely premium, resolving common complaint about the previous generation. It has a full metal band surrounding it, rather than a faux plastic one. Now, the feel in hand is comparable to the iPhone 6, and the design is elegant while familiar. Since the phone is so thin at 6.8 mm, the camera module protrudes slightly from the chassis, however it does not affect the phone. There is a sapphire lens to protect the camera, but placing the phone in a case should alleviate the protruding camera issue. Going to the front. there is a typical rectangular home button with a recent apps capacitive key on the left, with a back key on the right. Overall, the Galaxy S6 is the best phone Samsung has ever designed; however, the sealed battery and absence of a micro SD card slot may upset many. I do not replace the batteries in my phone nor add SD cards for storage, but customers from the Galaxy devices before may be unhappy. Tech Specs, Hardware Performance, Notable Features: The Galaxy in real life and on paper is a monster! Screen: It packs an amazing 5.1 Super AMOLED screen with a resolution of 2560x1440. The screen is capable of bright whites and dark blacks, and is the best mobile display currently on the market. Although Super AMOLED screens tend to have overly saturated colors, choosing AMOLED Cinema mode in settings creates natural colors. Fingerprint Scanner: Instead of a swipe based sensor, the new fingerprint scanner embedded in the home button is a capacitive touch based sensor, like the one on the iPhone 6. All you do is place your finger on the home button to unlock the phone. You can set up a total of 4 fingers, and the sensor is extremely reliable and useful. Every person using this phone should have the fingerprint sensor turned on since it provides good security while being intuitive to use. Camera: The camera is a 16 megapixel sensor with OIS. The Galaxy S6 has the best camera out of all Android phones, and easily competes with the iPhone 6 Plus. Because of the higher resolution, images are extremely detailed. The Optical Imaging Stabilization ensures pictures are clear, while videos are buttery smooth. The OIS also helps at night, as the sensor can pull in more light without creating a blurry image. The result is an amazing camera that can produce vibrant and beautiful pictures during the day, and a camera that can create accurate and bright pictures at night. The camera is also capable of 4K video recording, and slow motion video as well. An important new feature the Galaxy S6 incorporates is the double click on home button to activate. When you double click the home button, it opens the camera in less than 1 second! The ""just shoot"" mentality this camera gives its users is simply amazing and unmatched. For the pro users out there, the camera includes a professional mode that users can use to adjust ISO, white balance, and more settings. The front camera is 5 megapixels, and it is a strong front facing camera. Not much can be said about it, but it produces beautiful selfies and good colors, and is more than adequate for all users. Quick Charging and Wireless Charging: The Galaxy S6 is capable of adaptive quick charging using the charger supplied in the box. This charges the Galaxy S6 extremely fast; you can get about 4 hours of use only with 10 minutes of charging. The phone also supports other Qualcomm Quick Chargers. The Galaxy S6 also supports the",blublue,Samsung_S6,630

Everything about it screams that it wants to be the beast of all smart phones! OK let face it most of us who are adults and have maintained a phone plan for years have been using smartphones for the better part of a decade. The joys of gimmicky apps that make you look old or fat or really anything else have faded away, our smart phones have become important tools to us that we use for very adult things like keeping I touch paying bills and checking and sending emails and yes Instagram! Truth is we don't think much about these little unsung hero's living in our pockets or perses these days and just about nothing about them gets us too excited any more. Truth be told me and my wife only upgraded our phones because she dropped hers from half way up an 120ft ride at an amusement park. Needless to say her iPhone was destroyed so we knew it was new phone time. My wife has owned just about every iPhone and I have owned the Galaxy s 1,2,4 and now 6. The Galaxy s line were easily the best smartphones of the market where the 1,5 2 even three came out but the 4 and 5 were honestly nothing special. To be honest the s4 was going to be my last galaxy phone I was sure I was going to switch. It's not a big deal that they were mostly plastic I mean most electronics are, and the external part of the hardware was actually quite sturdy I've dropped all mine more the a few times through the years. There have been dings and dents but never ever a cracked screens and trust me there have been doozies! The problems with the Galaxy line were all internal, it was always a hardware issue that couldn't be fixed with an update that involved. Shipping it back to Samsung. Dude these are phones that basically cost a grand there brand new and I have to send them back to Samsung I mean come on?! My galaxy s1 would shut it's self off in your pocket, trust me it's annoying. My s2 got returned to the store for a bad screen. (in the s2 defence it was the greatest galaxy phone until the s6 in my opinion). My s4 oh my s4 this was the most annoying of all, it had a problem where it would eject my Sim at random causing me to loose phone and I internet signal, by the end I was ready to part from its company. Listen I'm not what you would call a phone activist if you like Apple great if you like android great. Personally I like them both android for my phone and apple for its iPad line witch is great for getting business done. Like I said I prefer android on my phone personally I think it's openness makes it better for a phone compared to apples ""walled garden"". So I was hopefull some day android would get apples beautiful sturdy superior hardware while running on Android that day has come! While I know Samsung wasn't the first in the Android world I think they have done it the best. Every thing about is quality, gone is all that plastic it's replaced by a glass front and back panel and a metal rim very apple like gone are the old creeks and clicks of the old gs phones. The fake silver paint that used to adorn the edges of so many gs phones is gone replaced by real metal. Trust me this phone is beautiful in my opinion the most beautiful android phone to date. The screen The screen on this little guy is amazing. Images look sharp and crisp, colors are bright and bold. Some people don't like this about Samsung amaloid screens where as I have always loved it. Things just look happier on Samsung amaloid screens, may be it's not as realistic but I don't care about that. Truth be told amaloid screens are one of the main reasons the gs line keeps me coming back, other companies screens no matter how many pixels just don't pop like amaloid displays do! That being the case the gs6 display has gone above and beyond here, look close and you won't see a single pixel. But to all this beauty the downside is a screen that drains your battery and quick.

The phone its self is absolutely amazing. Best display on a smartphone to date, best camera on a smartphone, beefy tech specs, attractive design, etc. All of this should warrant a 5 star review right? Wrong. The battery life on this phone is absolutely terrible. I have done my research and went out of my way to remove bloatware, adjust phone settings to conserve power, every little trick I could find online and still the battery life is not good enough for me to say ""it is a reliable phone"". The sad thing is that I don't think it is Samsung's fault. I think it has more to do with the wireless carrier (in my case Verizon, but I hear same issues exist with AT&T). Basically, I will charge my phone up to 100% (fast charge is great and works as advertised), then I just watch my battery drain even when my phone is inactive laying on my desk top. When I look at the battery statistics, something called ""call standby"" drains the phone battery even when I am not using it. In fact, it is by far the biggest battery drain on the phone even over a 4k super amoled display with full brightness. What the heck is going on Verizon? I looked into it further and saw many other people having the same issue. I noticed that my phone is always sending and receiving information to the Verizon network even when I am not using the phone. What is being sent? Does this have something to do with the NSA? Seriously. Last night I charged my phone to 100% just before bed, I cleared all apps loaded on the RAM just to see how what the battery percentage would be like in the morning and just sitting there on my night stand my phone drained 43% of the battery. Honestly, if this issue is not fixed, I am going to reactivate my old galaxy s5. I never had this issue on my s5. Hope this issue gets resolved soon or Verizon and Samsung just lost a long time customer.",dngray,Samsung_S6,632
6 of 6 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on June 7, 2015","Let me preface this with the following: 1. I've only had this phone a few days so I will likely have to edit this later and 2. I had an iPhone previously that I am still quite fond of. My iPhone 5 had started showing its age and experience serious lag issues. So after beating a dead horse with research I'd come down to the iPhone 6 or the Galaxy 6 -and part of me i still weighing the pros/cons - I decided on the Galaxy S6. These were the big decision makers for me: 1. 32GB, minimum memory, is apprx. $23/month using AT&T Next which is less than the 32GB mid tier iPhone 6 2. Samsung and Google have developed a very stable product 3. Camera and pixel density were a huge improvement over either my iPhone 5 or the 6 4. Samsung's Smart Switch App 5. It has two power save modes. I've heard a LOT about the battery life on this device being ""eh"", and experienced it some, granted I'm in transition mode. So I've switched on one of the power save modes. If memory serves, there isn't a power save mode on any iPhone. 6. MICRO USB -- i have lord know how many of these cords and they've all proven compatible without any issues (unlike a few of my lightning cables). The detractors: BLOATWARE!!! There's so much of it, however, you CAN disable those apps you don't like or want to use and I've done so. Otherwise it has all the same usability and functionality I would expect with an iPhone. So long as it continues to perform well and not give me any real issues. The learning curve between iPhone and the current Galaxy S6 is nominal at best. With that said, even if I ultimately return it at the end of my 14 day return period (which I probably won't...), it still deserves a 4.5-5 star rating because it's a fantastic device. Not too big, fairly easy to adjust too, and it's fun.",Stephanie Ann Miller,Samsung_S6,633
8 of 9 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on June 29, 2015","I was skeptical at first, but Samsung did a great job with this phone. Here are my thoughts on the phone *The screen is huge and beautiful. I sometimes forget I'm even looking at a screen. The colors are accurate, deep, and rich. The pixels are so plentiful that you can't even tell it's a screen. It moves so fluidly while watching videos. They did a stellar job. *The phone feels great in your hand. It feels like a quality phone. It is easy to hold. I am a small female and I can easily use the phone one handed. I don't worry about breaking it every second because it feels sturdy and well built. It never feels hot. It's not slippery, yet it slides easily in and out of a pocket or purse. *TouchWiz is definitely toned down. It still doesn't look like true Android OS, but it definitely looks better and runs more smooth. It was a huge improvement and TouchWiz now has more positives than negatives. *While there is still bloatware on the phone that you cannot get rid of without rooting your phone, it is way toned down from previous Samsung phones. Even the bloatware you're stuck with can be hidden - you can disable the app and/or completely hide it from view anywhere on the phone. So while it still takes up space, you can easily pretend it isn't there. *Battery life is great AFTER you make adjustments. Turn on Power Saving Mode at all times. You won't notice a difference in the functionality of your phone, but it will add to battery life. Also disable background data on apps that you don't need notifications from - I disabled it on apps like the Play Store. Finally, make sure you set the Play Store to only update apps on WiFi so you don't use massive amounts of data. *Ultra Power Save Mode is neat when you must use it. Your phone will look like a basic grayscale screen with only access to basic things like phone calls and texting. Everything else is shut down. It's great for emergencies when you need your phone to still work, can't charge it, and the battery is super low. It will last for days! *The themes are a lot of fun. If you don't like or get bored with the look of the UI, you can change it with themes. They have a ton of them available for free now and you can switch amongst them in just a few seconds. It's a lot of fun! *I like that you can change the size of the screens to fit more icons if needed. It's a very handy feature for people who want to fit more on one screen! It adds more to your homescreen without making things smaller. *The Google Calendar widget is not the native Google Calendar widget. It only shows you a month view which isn't very helpful. I had to download the real Google Calendar from the Play Store and it allows me to still have the agenda style widget. Annoying, but an easy fix. *I have crappy fingerprints so the fingerprint scanner doesn't work super well for me. However, considering what an awful time most things have reading my fingerprint, this does relatively well. I have tested many other people's fingerprints (including immediate family) and it will never unlock for them. So it has exceeded my expectations. It also reads super fast which just a quick swipe. *Call quality is great. I always receive my calls and other people always sound great and they always sound great to me. I don't ever seen to drop calls or have poor reception. *One small annoyance is the light that blinks to tell you that you have a notification... it's very slow. I have to stare at my phone for a good 7-8 seconds to see it blink each time. I wish the blink speed was faster so it would be easier to tell if I had a notification. *The rapid charging feature is AMAZING!!! It still shocks me how fast the phone really does charge. Even when I use my phone a ton and the battery does drop, a quick 10-15 minute charge gives me about a whole days worth right there! It's such a lifesaver. Just remember that it only works with the included charger or another charger that puts out more power. It won't worth with any standard charger. *I li",Lauren Renee,Samsung_S6,634
8 of 9 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on May 6, 2015","I have both an iPhone 6 (personal) and the Galaxy S6 (work) and here's what I can tell you after using both: The S6 is the first and only android I have tested that feels as smooth and natural as an iPhone. You really have to credit Apple who was able to develop an OS that has been quite fluid through their previous generations of iPhones. Kudos for Samsung for finally bringing this fluidity to Android users (and SHAME on Apple for ""bricking"" my older iPhones with their updates. I swear they do that on purpose to force you to upgrade.) Both these phones feel almost identical in the hand. I hate the S6 camera protrusion. I am in constant fear of breaking the lens. I know I can use a case but I do not like to use cases under normal circumstances. Putting a case on these stunning phones is tantamount to putting a trench coat on Sofia Vergara. Plus it makes the phone feel larger. I feel way more confident with the iPhone. The iPhone's camera, while technically being inferior, seems to take better photos overall. This has been hit and miss. The iPhone fingerprint reader is superior. The S6 is better than the S5 but still lagging behind. The surface area of the reader is a long oval vs. a perfect circle. I rarely have misreads with the iPhone while the Samsung sometimes doesn't read my print correctly. The Samsung's screen is STUNNING. The iPhone is no slouch but in this case AMOLED beats Retina. The Samsung is fast. I mean fast. Everything it does is fast. Unfortunately the battery drains just as fast. Fortunately, the fast charging option works FAST and a cheap aftermarket wireless charger is just a wonderful option. There is an ultra low power mode which reverts your phone to a circa 1990s Motorola StarTac (black & white screen and all!) but it really stretches out your battery life. I rarely use my charging cable anymore. I really do wish however that I had the option to replace my battery though. The iPhone battery life stinks as well but the S6 is worse. The S6 has more options to compensate. Internet browsing and phone calls are nearly identical. The iPhone speaker is a bit louder and sounds better. I really hate Apple lately but you just can't beat iTunes or the Apple store for apps. Google play and Amazon just feel second rate. Some dual platform apps feel better on the iPhone while others feel better on the Galaxy. Google doesn't have the personality of Siri but I find it is easier and more accurate. Also, the Google app is always listening and doesn't require a key press to activate. This is both convenient and unnerving since I sometimes believe Google is the devil. The GUIs both have their quirks and advantages. I feel that Android, while having more options and customization, has always felt like an OS on top of an OS. Always endless menus to get things done. I guess this is the price that comes with the power to customize. Samsung has made navigation much easier with this last version of their TouchWiz and most of the bloat is gone. I love the ""back"" key on Android. As an iPhone user you don't miss it until you have a phone that offers it...especially if you like one-handed operation. I still believe iPhone has the advantage here. FaceTime rocks. I don't care what any Android user thinks but connectivity to all things Apple is just so cool. FaceTime is just one facet of this. Android diehards probably won't understand this. I miss an SD slot. Whether it was Blackberry, Android, etc., I have carried my photos, videos, documents, etc. from all my previous non-iPhone devices to newer models in a seamless fashion. Continuation... I just compared video taken with both phones (same locations) on my 60"" LED TV. The S6 looks like it was taken with a dedicated camcorder. My guests could not believe the quality. I don't have a 4K TV but the difference between the two was noticeable on the big screen. Maybe its the lens? Maybe the pre/post processing? Maybe a combination of several factors. The iPhone however did seem to balance",Dr. Manhattan,Samsung_S6,635

I'm a complete phone nerd (XDA Developers Recognized Contributor, if that means anything to you) so I massively over analyze these things. It's a VERY nice phone but it's got some things that I consider drawbacks. For my wife, all the drawbacks listed below were non issues. She didn't care about these issues. So understand that my 'drawbacks' are completely subjective to your personal needs. But they are things that you should be aware of and consider if they mean anything to you before purchasing. ?????THE UPSIDES????? ? The screen is incredible. Like really incredible. The resolution is better than my eye can see. I use a Galaxy S4 as my regular phone and it has great resolution where you can't see individual pixels. I thought the S4 screen was as good as you can get, but the S6 screen takes it to a whole new level. Even though you can't see pixels on either screen, the higher resolution of the S6 screen makes everything look so sharp that it's nearly impossible to tell you are looking at a screen. It's that incredible. ? The design of the phone just feels more 'expensive'. I mean that in a good way. It feels just higher quality than previous models in the Galaxy S line. The S3 and S4 for example are often critiqued for having a plastic shell. The S6 has a metal band around the outside that just makes it feel 'premium' in your hand. It should also provide more protection for the device as well. ? TouchWiz is HEAVILY scaled back. I hate TouchWiz (Samsung's version of Android) It adds a layer of UI that is neither helpful nor intuitive. And it's a resource hog which slows the phone down for important tasks just so it can make the scrolling smoother, and other such useless tradeoffs. On the S6 TouchWiz was barely noticeable. The UI looks more like the standard Google Android Lollipop interface. It was all just much smoother and simpler and better and wonderful. ? Camera. 16 MP. And the images it takes look stunning on the super HD screen. Those photos on a larger high resolution monitor are simply stunning. ?????THE DOWNSIDES????? ? The battery is not removable or easily replaceable. A cell phone battery has a life of about 500 charge cycles. I tend to keep my phones for 2 years as daily users, then I keep my old phones for a variety of other purposes around the house. (My old HTC Sensation is hooked up to my stereo for use as a nice wifi streaming media player with a touchscreen UI, for example) I eventually have a need to replace batteries because I wear them out. I like being able to go on Amazon, spent $20 on a replacement battery, pop it in and be done. Additionally, even if you don't keep your phones that long, batteries fail sometimes. The stock batteries on the Galaxy S4 had some problems. They were minimal, but for those affected the battery absolutely had to be replaced. On the S4 it took 8 seconds and the problem was solved. On the S6 I'm sure it would be covered by warranty but it'd be a pain to take it somewhere to have it worked on should the issue come up. So no replaceable battery is a deal killer for me. This might not be an issue for you. If not, great! But be aware of the issue before making purchase decisions. ? You can't expand the storage with an SD Card. I don't want to live in the cloud. I hate the cloud. Sometimes I'm not on an LTE network. Sometimes I'm in the middle of nowhere but still want to show someone pictures of my kids. I got my wife the 32GB model. That sounds like a lot, but keep in mind that some of that is dedicated for the operating system and user apps. So you don't get to use all 32GB. The S6 is going to be available in up to 128GB, which ends my problem with not liking the cloud option. Again, you might not care. If not, great! My wife doesn't keep a lot of stuff on her phone. She moves all her pictures to her computer and never loaded video to watch on her phone, so the storage thing wasn't a big deal to he",Obi Wan,Samsung_S6,636

I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. Samsung Galaxy S6 tries to be a revolutionary, but it is evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. So do check local specs. I played around with both S6 and S6 Edge for few days and my opinions are based on this. There are tons of reviews going into lot of details, so I am focused on few other aspects like what’s out there and how to compare specs. First Big Changes: No microSD or removable battery. I know many of you loyal Samsung fans says BUMMER! I was a die hard fan of Samsung till S4, then I went to LG G2/G3. I think this is the best bet for S6 to pull it off after a dismal year for Samsung last year. I was very curious to try out S6 and HTC One M9 as they are most talked about now. Many manufacturers are going away from microSD card slots and this is absolutely a must and is a key differentiator from iPhone. I am really sad Samsung decided to drop microSD card slot as well as no removable battery. Why?! Screen is a beauty on S6 – Just Gorgeous. Just go to a retail store and feel it! The Edge feature is still gimmicky. Unlike Note Edge, this has both sides so less dorky but still I am not sold yet. Unless you have loads of money, I will shy away from it for one more year and get it next year when they polish it up. It is certainly fancy and nice to show off, but I would rather buy an Android wear watch like Motorola 360 or Samsung Gear or LG R series. I like Motorola 360 but waiting for version 2 to appear. I like Round watches. IF YOU HAVE LAST YEAR model of any phone, PLEASE DON’T upgrade. Phones are becoming so standard and power packed it makes no sense to upgrade and waste money every year. I buy and sell so many phones as it is like a hobby for me, but I stick to one phone as primary for couple of years now. My main requirements are a 128 GB microSD, good screen, battery life and performance. I am trying hard to see if I can live without one. S6 and S6 Edge comes in a 128 GB variant and I will wait for prices to stabilize on this model. In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size, weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability.

4 of 4 people found the following review helpful,4,,"on June 4, 2015","This is detailed, it’s long, it’s my personal experience, hopefully I can prove to the readers what real world use of the phone feels like. I owned a Samsung Galaxy S4 (T-Mobile) before acquiring my GS6 more than two weeks ago. I was unhappy with my GS4 but I stuck with it for 2 years, then came the GS6. It provides a lot of what I felt the GS4 was missing or not properly executing. I dislike riding the hype train and “upgrading” phones every year they are released so I passed on the Galaxy S5, even though it offers up some very important features I value, such as a waterproof body and expandable memory, which Samsung got rid of and is leaving some of those features for their “Samsung GS6 Active” phone released later this year no doubt.. »DESIGN« This phone completely resembles what would happen if and iphone and an Android had a baby, plenty of side by side photo comparisons to support my claim. I’ve never really cared about the metal vs. plastic, it’s all beef created from Apple vs. Android fans for the most part, but the aluminum + glass feels really good. Every single phone I have ever owned goes straight into a case from the moment I remove it from it’s original packaging. It’s it smart phone, and it’s a smart idea to protect it, with a phone case. I never really considered buying the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, because like the Galaxy S4, the GS6 Edge variant is one giant gimmick. The curved screen is the only reason someone would immediately know it’s an S6 vs a S5/S4. It’s also more expensive, for little to no good reason. »THE GUTS« Since I like to buy my phones every two years, I feel compelled to purchase the best my money can buy, so I go straight for the Flagships. This flagship phone comes with it’s own Samsung Exynos 7420 Octa-core Processor instead of a Snapdragon 810 (Battery Hog!) or a Snapdragon 808 (a 810 but with 2 processors turned off) like the LG G4 is featuring or maybe more phones releasing later this year. Not sure about you guys, but I don’t see the point in paying for last year’s technology. 5.1” QHD 2560x1440p Screen (any bigger and it gets harder to use with 1 hand) Lets talk about the camera for a moment. This is the best camera-phone I’ve had a chance to use, my brother who has had the Iphone 6 plus since the beginning of the year seems to agree with me, this coming from a heavy selfie/social media user. These cameras paired up with powerful software on newer phones are no laughing matter anymore. »16 MP Rear Camera »5 MP Front Camera (Wide) »F1.9 Aperture size, I dumped my Sony Cybershot 10.1 for this camera! »Camera features: AF Assist Beam, Optical image stabilization, Manual focus, Face detection, Smile detection, Digital zoom, Voice activation, Self-timer, Back-illuminated sensor (BSI), Autofocus, Touch to focus, Geo tagging, HDR and then some! seriously... »Camcorder features: 3840x2160 (4K) (30 fps), 1920x1080 (1080p HD) (60 fps), 1280x720 (720p HD) (120 fps) also…. Optical image stabilization, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Continuous autofocus, Picture-taking during video recording, Video light, Video calling -My experience with the camera has been a very positive user experience, it exceeds my expectations. Double tapping the home button immediately launches the camera app, no matter what your doing on the phone. You don’t know how useful this is until you actually use it. Pictures turn out great, no crazy autofocus wait times like my older phones and cameras would do. -The Camcorder isn’t quite the same. Once you select to record video in anything Higher then 1080p (30FPS) such as 4K Ultra High Definition, all of those really nice features disappear. The result is a much, much better crisp clear video, that turns off HDR, Video effects, Video stabilization (this one is really important), taking pictures while recording, and tracking autofocus. Also! You made only record for exactly 5 minutes while recording video in Ultra HD! The phone is firing on all engines when doing this so it heats",Mr. DR,Samsung_S6,638

This thing is so smooth and powerful that its hard to believe phone internals and tech have come along this far even in two years. I was a little upset that they got rid of the removable battery and the expandable memory, but then kind of thought about how little i really accessed those two thing on my S4. Say goodbye to the plastic casing. Not that this really bothered me because I always put my phones in a case, but the finish on this thing is incredible. Previously I didn't think much about wireless charging. Now... LOVE IT. Being able to just plunk this thing down on a pad and walk away is great. I have yet to have an issue with it connecting on first placement onto the CHOE Stadium Qi Wireless Charger. Even with a Spigen Neo Hybrid case wrapped around it. Camera... So smooth and quick on boot up. Double click the home button even with the phone is idle and BAM the camera is up and running and ready to shoot. Just remember to remove the little protective cover around the lens that they place there for shipping. The screen is beautiful and colors are very vivid. Brightness can range from almost nonexistent to nice and visible in the noon sun. One tip I will share is go ahead and sign up for the advanced calling (aka HD Voice) with Verizon. With out doing that you will not have data and calling at the same time. From what I have read it has to do with they removed an antenna in the phone to either slim the phone down or to free up space for other things, and that everyone is moving to the new Voice over LTE system anyway. No extra cost. Google ""advanced calling 1.0"" and you can get the details.",BrnFrnld,Samsung_S6,639
9 of 11 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 14, 2015","I got a chance to test a Galaxy S6 out and immediately bought one for my wife. I'm a complete phone nerd (XDA Developers Recognized Contributor, if that means anything to you) so I massively over analyze these things. It's a VERY nice phone but it's got some things that I consider drawbacks. For my wife, all the drawbacks listed below were non issues. She didn't care about these issues. So understand that my 'drawbacks' are completely subjective to your personal needs. But they are things that you should be aware of and consider if they mean anything to you before purchasing. ?????THE UPSIDES????? ? The screen is incredible. Like really incredible. The resolution is better than my eye can see. I use a Galaxy S4 as my regular phone and it has great resolution where you can't see individual pixels. I thought the S4 screen was as good as you can get, but the S6 screen takes it to a whole new level. Even though you can't see pixels on either screen, the higher resolution of the S6 screen makes everything look so sharp that it's nearly impossible to tell you are looking at a screen. It's that incredible. ? The design of the phone just feels more 'expensive'. I mean that in a good way. It feels just higher quality than previous models in the Galaxy S line. The S3 and S4 for example are often critiqued for having a plastic shell. The S6 has a metal band around the outside that just makes it feel 'premium' in your hand. It should also provide more protection for the device as well. ? TouchWiz is HEAVILY scaled back. I hate TouchWiz (Samsung's version of Android) It adds a layer of UI that is neither helpful nor intuitive. And it's a resource hog which slows the phone down for important tasks just so it can make the scrolling smoother, and other such useless tradeoffs. On the S6 TouchWiz was barely noticeable. The UI looks more like the standard Google Android Lollipop interface. It was all just much smoother and simpler and better and wonderful. ? Camera. 16 MP. And the images it takes look stunning on the super HD screen. Those photos on a larger high resolution monitor are simply stunning. ?????THE DOWNSIDES????? ? The battery is not removable or easily replaceable. A cell phone battery has a life of about 500 charge cycles. I tend to keep my phones for 2 years as daily users, then I keep my old phones for a variety of other purposes around the house. (My old HTC Sensation is hooked up to my stereo for use as a nice wifi streaming media player with a touchscreen UI, for example) I eventually have a need to replace batteries because I wear them out. I like being able to go on Amazon, spent $20 on a replacement battery, pop it in and be done. Additionally, even if you don't keep your phones that long, batteries fail sometimes. The stock batteries on the Galaxy S4 had some problems. They were minimal, but for those affected the battery absolutely had to be replaced. On the S4 it took 8 seconds and the problem was solved. On the S6 I'm sure it would be covered by warranty but it'd be a pain to take it somewhere to have it worked on should the issue come up. So no replaceable battery is a deal killer for me. This might not be an issue for you. If not, great! But be aware of the issue before making purchase decisions. ? You can't expand the storage with an SD Card. I don't want to live in the cloud. I hate the cloud. Sometimes I'm not on an LTE network. Sometimes I'm in the middle of nowhere but still want to show someone pictures of my kids. I got my wife the 32GB model. That sounds like a lot, but keep in mind that some of that is dedicated for the operating system and user apps. So you don't get to use all 32GB. The S6 is going to be available in up to 128GB, which ends my problem with not liking the cloud option. Again, you might not care. If not, great! My wife doesn't keep a lot of stuff on her phone. She moves all her pictures to her computer and never loaded video to watch on her phone, so the storage thing wasn't a big deal to he",Obi Wan,Samsung_S6,640
6 of 7 people found the following review helpful,3,,"on April 13, 2015","I bought the S6 edge 32gb the day it came out, April 10th, from Best Buy so I could get the free wireless charger. After a day with the phone, I decided the $100 extra wasn't worth it, and decided to exchange for the S6 64GB. There were some other factors besides money. The edge screen was too weird to get used to while playing certain games that require touching the top of the screen. Since I wasn't in love with the screen, it didn't make sense for me to keep it and opted for the 64GB ""regular"" S6 for the extra storage if I need it. As a disclaimer, I have used a lot of different Android phones. Nexus 5, HTC One m7&m8, Xperia z3, Note 2,3,4, and a bunch of other phones I don't know off the top of my head. The phone I had prior to this phone was the LG G3 and I had the G2 some time ago. The phone is great when it comes to build quality. It's light and feels premium, however the untrained eye won't notice the difference between an s4,s5 and s6, so don't think you're going to get compliments on the phone from ""regular"" phone users that only know iPhone and non-iPhone. There's nothing really to different than a s4,s5,s6, especially if you have a case on it. The good things I liked about the phone. I have had it for 2 days, and will be taking it back to Best Buy today to go back to my G3, however the good things about the phone are that it has a great camera. Very fast when it comes to taking pictures, the slow motion mode is fun to play with and every video and picture I took were very sharp. I don't usually care for cell phone cameras since we have a DSLR, but if you need to take footage of something right away, this doesn't disappoint. Double tap the home button and you can take a picture in about 1-1.5 seconds when the screen is off. The speaker is loud. Much louder than the G3. It gets distorted at max level, but you can still make out a song or spoken words. It seems about as loud as the Amazon Fire Phone, maybe louder, and that phone's speaker was pretty loud. The display is very nice. Better than the 9 month old G3, and one of the reasons I wanted to buy a Samsung again is that I missed their displays. I would say it's the best display on the market. Now for the bad. I'm going to make this quick because I have stuff to do, but here are my thoughts on the phone after using it almost nonstop for the past 2 days -The Exynos chip is fast, and octacore seems like a great idea, but I still like snapdragon processors. A few of the games I normally play on my g3, and have been playing since the snapdragon 600 processor on the HTC One M7, lag on the S6. It's quite noticeable. I play popular games that update frequently and there's still stutter and lag. I also noticed a lot of lag on certain websites, especially in ""desktop mode"". Unacceptable to have a brand new chip with 3gb RAM and there's lag on websites. I don't have any issues with my G3 in that sense, which is one of the reasons I'm going back. Other processes like camera opening, gallery opening, and opening most system apps are lightning fast. In my personal use of the product, games and web browsing is lacking. -I don't know if it's a bad device, but there's a couple of games I play and there's a hissing throughout playing. It's only on the game. When I exit either game, the hissing stops. I don't know why, and frankly don't care. A brand new flagship need not have this issue. -The battery. This is a big one. A small, non-replaceable battery that doesn't last a long time in my opinion. I used the wireless charger to charge the phone overnight. In about 5 hours it got up to 99%. Never hit 100% until I plugged it into the wall. That's weird to me. Maybe it's the technology that I don't know about, but it should charge to 100%. I charged it in the car on my way to work. I took it off the charger, and in about 15 minutes of not even using the phone, 1% drained. Right now I have 1 hour and 27 mins of screen on time and my battery is at 53%. That's a little over 3 hours of scre",Dephtones,Samsung_S6,641

3 of 3 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 15, 2015","Have owned an S3, S4, Note 4, and now S6. Samsung makes an excellent product. The S6 was for my son who is at college studying to be an engineer. He LOVES this phone. The phone is fast, sleek, logical, intuitive and highly functional. We are amazed at each successive generation for the improvements and innovation that bring the Samsung product along. One benefit not often though of is that Samsung seems to develop and support software updates more frequently. They roll out the updates to many other older generations of their lines too which means your phone stays much more functional and safe for the time you own it. Some brands do not seem to roll out updates as Samsung does-it is not that there are issues but that they constantly innovate. This fact along is reason enough to purchase a S6 but paired with the excellent aesthetics and quality build-you can't go wrong. **Please note-I do not recommend trading in your old cell phone through Amazon. The phone that this new S6 replaced was sent in it's original box, in perfect working order with excellent battery & original equipment cables having been protected by cases & screen protectors throughout it's 2 yrs of usage. It very clearly met the criteria listed for being in the top tier yet it was downgraded to a lower value. After it a long shipping voyage there, now they shipped it back (not yet received!) taking many weeks! Amazon evidently uses vendors to evaluate trade ins-had I know it was a third party then I would never have bothered! This is a money making venture but not for you the consumer. Don't make the mistake of factoring in a trade in for your purchase of a new phone. If you do decide to flip the coin and try it-take photos of the phone, photos of serial numbers and photos of every single thing. I do not recommend that you use Amazon trade in for your old phone. This one was in perfect condition and only 2 years old top quality-premium phone still sold today! Better to keep it as a spare of donate it & write it off your taxes. Very frustrated and extremely dis-satisfied by the trade in experience-especially as it was through Amazon. I honestly expect more and this will influence whether I purchase another phone through Amazon or if I go to my carrier who had an offer of $100 for trade in value on this phone. Lesson learned-it pays to shop around and factor in your trade in value with the purchase but I choose to be loyal to Amazon rather than my carrier. Some things we don't like are NO SD card! Though you can readily use cloud services of many kinds to safeguard your info, many of us still prefer to have that SD card. I also am not a huge fan of not being able to remove the battery myself. This model moves towards the Apple method of doing things where any little thing you want done has to be done at a store, shipped in or can't be done! Screen: The Gorilla glass is excellent and top quality. The clarity and resolution of the screen is outstanding-just when I thought my Note 4 was the greatest, they go and improve within the few months between the time that it came out and the new S6. Conclusion: I highly recommend this phone. We have two tablets, and have had five Samsung phones and been very happy with them all. They work well together and the quality is outstanding.",Technocat,Samsung_S6,643
3 of 3 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 12, 2015","This year, Samsung kept everything much more simple, intuitive, and beautiful. As a result, the Galaxy S6 is the best smartphone any person can currently. My review will focus on 3 key aspects: exterior design and materials, tech specs and hardware performance, and interface and ui. I will also point out outstanding and new features along the way. Exterior Design: Although at first the Galaxy S6 may not look completely different from the Galaxy S5, it is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor. The 2 sheets of Gorilla Glass 4 adorning the front and back make the phone feel extremely premium, resolving common complaint about the previous generation. It has a full metal band surrounding it, rather than a faux plastic one. Now, the feel in hand is comparable to the iPhone 6, and the design is elegant while familiar. Since the phone is so thin at 6.8 mm, the camera module protrudes slightly from the chassis, however it does not affect the phone. There is a sapphire lens to protect the camera, but placing the phone in a case should alleviate the protruding camera issue. Going to the front. there is a typical rectangular home button with a recent apps capacitive key on the left, with a back key on the right. Overall, the Galaxy S6 is the best phone Samsung has ever designed; however, the sealed battery and absence of a micro SD card slot may upset many. I do not replace the batteries in my phone nor add SD cards for storage, but customers from the Galaxy devices before may be unhappy. Tech Specs, Hardware Performance, Notable Features: The Galaxy in real life and on paper is a monster! Screen: It packs an amazing 5.1 Super AMOLED screen with a resolution of 2560x1440. The screen is capable of bright whites and dark blacks, and is the best mobile display currently on the market. Although Super AMOLED screens tend to have overly saturated colors, choosing AMOLED Cinema mode in settings creates natural colors. Fingerprint Scanner: Instead of a swipe based sensor, the new fingerprint scanner embedded in the home button is a capacitive touch based sensor, like the one on the iPhone 6. All you do is place your finger on the home button to unlock the phone. You can set up a total of 4 fingers, and the sensor is extremely reliable and useful. Every person using this phone should have the fingerprint sensor turned on since it provides good security while being intuitive to use. Camera: The camera is a 16 megapixel sensor with OIS. The Galaxy S6 has the best camera out of all Android phones, and easily competes with the iPhone 6 Plus. Because of the higher resolution, images are extremely detailed. The Optical Imaging Stabilization ensures pictures are clear, while videos are buttery smooth. The OIS also helps at night, as the sensor can pull in more light without creating a blurry image. The result is an amazing camera that can produce vibrant and beautiful pictures during the day, and a camera that can create accurate and bright pictures at night. The camera is also capable of 4K video recording, and slow motion video as well. An important new feature the Galaxy S6 incorporates is the double click on home button to activate. When you double click the home button, it opens the camera in less than 1 second! The ""just shoot"" mentality this camera gives its users is simply amazing and unmatched. For the pro users out there, the camera includes a professional mode that users can use to adjust ISO, white balance, and more settings. The front camera is 5 megapixels, and it is a strong front facing camera. Not much can be said about it, but it produces beautiful selfies and good colors, and is more than adequate for all users. Quick Charging and Wireless Charging: The Galaxy S6 is capable of adaptive quick charging using the charger supplied in the box. This charges the Galaxy S6 extremely fast; you can get about 4 hours of use only with 10 minutes of charging. The phone also supports other Qualcomm Quick Chargers. The Galaxy S6 also supports the",blublue,Samsung_S6,644
3 of 3 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 10, 2015","Wow, what a difference a year makes. While last year's S5 took many steps in the right direction(being somewhat waterproof with better material and craftsmanship), it still wasn't there to make it a mouth-watering phone yet, like what HTC did when they first introduced their One M7, or whenever Apple introduces a new iPhone size. This year, Samsung has finally learned from both of their competitors, and made a phone that has all the good qualities of both, plus some of their own. Finally, this is the Galaxy S that you've always wanted and been dreaming of. * LOOKS/FORM-FACTOR/MATERIALS: The very first thing you notice when you handle the phone, is its new design and form factor - finally Samsung has completed their transformation of getting rid of all that ugly plastic parts. Now it is just all glass and metal, and now it is truly beautiful. The metal fully wraps around the edges ofthe phone. The back is beautiful, the sides are beautiful - heck, even the buttons are beautiful. It feels great in the hand, and oozes style and sophistication. * SCREEN: The very next thing you notice, of course, is the screen. I am continually pleasantly surprised at the evolution of Samsung's AMOLED technology - it has now became the best screen in the industry, hands down. I used to defend the LCD technology of the HTC M7, and at that point it was in fact overall superior to the Samsung S4 because the AMOLED then had issues in the sun, and color reproduction(it was too saturated and not natural). But now, they have fixed those issues, and the S6's screen is just quite simply the best. If you don't believe it, just compare an LG/Samsung OLED TV to any LED TVs today. I still think 5.1 inches for a screen of a PHONE is still too big, but overall, for what smartphones represent nowadays, it is acceptable - we have conditioned ourselves to accept the bigger sizes of smartphones(I remember when I first held a 4.2"" smartphone when it first came out - the HTC HD2 - and thought, ""what the h3ll is this monstrosity??""). * It doesn't hurt that Samsung boosted up the resolution to 1440 x 2560 pixels, which is approximately 577 ppi in pixel density. Although this is quite overkill right now, it's always nice to have the latest and greatest technology - that's the reason why we buy these overpriced phones in the first place, isn't it? It is also very bright, and sunlit legibility is excellent. Color reproduction is quite accurate, and like the S5, you can choose different color modes to suit your liking. *BATTERY LIFE: An important aspect to discuss is the battery life, now more than ever because there is no removable back cover to make replacing the battery easily like before, not to mention there is no microSD slot for you to add memory space to your phone. Comparatively, the S6 Edge is supposed to last a little less than the S6 regular, which I've read is less than last year's S5. But I'm one of those who are always around a charger, and I always carry external battery packs in my backpack when I travel, so that's never a concern. Seriously, who even buys an extra battery anymore - which you can only use for a single specific phone model - when your external battery can charge ANY and ALL phones and tablets?? This scenario only makes sense if your work is so demanding that you don't have extra time to charge the phone, and need to swap batteries IMMEDIATELY. I don't think that scenario is realistic nowadays when external batteries are so small, light, and cheap. My S6 goes from 100% at 10 am to about 20% at 10 pm with moderate use - so no complaints there. I get home, plug it up, and there are no issues. * What's better this year, is the wireless charging standards are already built into the phone, so you can just buy a charging pad for about $50 and feel even more cool. * USER INTERFACE/SOFTWARE: The Samsung user interface called TouchWiz used to be bloated and sluggish. It would slow down(navigating throughout the phone, switching between apps, and using",Johnny Amazon®,Samsung_S6,645

So $700 for 1st phone, $200 for each replacement. I'm 3 phones down, $1100 later and I have another burned out phone with cracked backing.

5 of 6 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on May 15, 2015","I finally broke from my long-term relationship with BlackBerry. The first few days were difficult but glad I did it. The Galaxy S6 and apps are great, and since I bought a Samsung tablet several months ago, both the Samsung and Android functions were fairly familiar to me. Within a few hours, I removed some of the apps I don't care about and easily downloaded others, using either Google Play or just doing a voice recognition Google search ""OK Google, get me the ABC app."" Several things were driving me crazy, however, and the sales people gave no satisfactory answers. But I found solutions so let me share them here. The biggest problem was how to sync my contacts and calendar between the S6 and Outlook on my PC. No one seemed to have a decent answer. Sales guy said: Buy Microsoft 365, download it onto both your PC and the S6 and sync that way. Seemed reasonable, especially since a personal license is now $65 (first year) for three devices (PC, tablet and mobile). Unfortunately, Microsoft 365 wouldn't download correctly, Microsoft customer service never called me back even though the web said I'd hear from them within six minutes, and several YouTube videos say the Microsoft instructions actually don't work and then try to show how to do it. Wow, you'd think by now they'd have this down. Plus, I already have all the Office functions on my PC and you can now get mobile versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint for free at Google Apps so this seemed stupid in retrospect, especially since it didn’t work. I looked at various apps that supposedly do the sync and even posed a question on an Amazon forum. No solutions. Then an engineer friend told me to try Sync 2, which gave me free use for several weeks and I can then buy a one-time license for around $39.95. Went to their web site, downloaded their software, found the instructions amazingly understandable, and watched as their system then moved my contacts, calendar and tasks to my existing Google account even though I’ve never shared contacts or calendar with Google in the past and even though I don’t use Google for my email and still don’t. Sure enough, everything got transferred into my Google account, and when I went to my S6 to see how I could then sync my contacts and calendar on the S6 with my Google contacts and calendar, it turns out the S6 had already synced since it already had my Google account name and password. I find the S6 is now regularly staying in sync, in slightly different format from Outlook but something I can easily get used to. I also find that when I now send any emails, as is the case with Outlook on my PC, the S6 email system draws upon my contacts and when I do hands free calling, including from my car, I get the same great interlinks. In other words, Sync 2 keeps my PC contacts and calendar in sync at Google (even though I largely don’t use Google) and my S6 in turn uses that Google account to do its sync. A great solution. You'd think the techies would realize that the millions of us who actually use our mobile devices for work would need something like this. Second, unlike my old BlackBerry (which always gave me a choice) or my Samsung tablet, whenever I deleted email on the S6, it was deleting the emails on the servers, which I didn't want since I archive important emails on my PC. Sales people said: don't delete your emails then, and it's a problem with your Internet service provider anyway. Wrong. If you explore the settings on the S6, about three levels down (from email accounts, not general settings -- it's definitely NOT intuitive), there's a place where you can set the handling of incoming email on each email account you have linked to your S6 – “always delete” or “never delete.” I switched each account to “never delete” and the problem is solved. And finally, my signature lines were looking awful, and many web forums said there was no way to fix this. But I found one forum that had an amazing solution: Send yourself an email with the signature bl",Road Warrior,Samsung_S6,647

I will continue to update this review in the future. This review should be the similar to Galaxy S6 on other carriers such as Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile. Pros: - No more plastics and cheap material. Samsung is finally giving us the hardware that we've long desired. By far, the best designed Galaxy phone to date imo - 5.1 in, QHD Super AMOLED screen. The screen is absolutely gorgeous that it hurts my eyes a bit. I'm still adjusting to it. - 16MP Camera with Smart OIS and 5MP front camera. Very well specs, but even better in performance. In short, the best camera on any android phones. I cannot believe that the picture came out so well in low light environment. You have to try it yourself to believe how great these low light pictures come out. - Gorilla Glass 4 panels for front and back (reminds me of the iPhone 4 and Nexus 4). Gorilla Glass are known to be tough and scratch resistance. - Comes in various colors: White, black, gold, green, blue (US only get the white, black, and gold unfortunately) - Comes in 32, 64, or 128GB of built-in memory. (For the 32gb - 3.7gb is for system partition, 25.2 for data/apps/pictures) - Less of the TouchWiz’s gimmicky features like the eye scroll, eye away from the screen pause. So we will not be experiencing the same slowdown or low storage as we did with earlier versions. If the GS4/5 were all about the features, this phone is all about the design. I do like the camera app and how they add a ""close all"" into the recent screen. - Rapid charging (need to use this more to confirm their claim of 4hrs of battery in 10 minute charge - UPDATED 5/1/15 i am getting about 1 to 1 1/2 hrs of use after the 10 minute charge, I'm guessing the 4hr claim is idle??) - Wireless charging - So if you have extra money that you want to drop for a wireless charging dock, you will be able to use it with this phone. Cons (Not necessarily apply to everyone): - No removable back panel. - No removable battery. I’m a battery hog, so I’m always draining my battery by 3-4pm. Not being able to just swap out my battery will be a pain, but let’s wait to see if the battery swap will be needed in a month when I fully test this device. - Lower battery capacity - 2550mAh compared to the 2600mAh in GS4 and 2800mAh in GS5. With the new processor, battery usage should be more efficient so it should not be a big deal, but end-users would rather the capacity to increase than decrease (Will update if this make through a day of normal usage, UPDATED 5/1/15 - I'm getting average about 8-9 hrs of normal usage, not ideal but I'll manage) - No waterproofing like the GS5, but I never used a smartphone that was waterproofed before, so not a big issue ""to me"" - No ability to swap out memory card – Might bother some Galaxy fans, but with the higher memory options, I do not think this is a huge problem. - Still no on-screen navigation button – Might only be a problem for ""pure"" Android fan. - Rear Camera and Flash sticks out a bit and not flush with the back panel. - Front and back glass is a potential problem as we all experiences with iPhone 4 and Nexus 4.

I was happy with that phone, up until just recently it started to have some glitches. Went ahead , and got the S6. This device is no doubt faster, and has a great display. If you use applications a lot, you'll love it. The actual phone is marginal at best. Low volume, (I had to do an exchange on my first purchase as peoples voices were crackly). The speakerphone is fine, but I use the actual phone. Im seriously disappointed in that, the S3 is easily 10 times better. I could make it as loud as necessary when needed. With the 6 its low with a marginal volume boost. In my opinion this is a great droid, and disappointing actual phone. Better like charging too as its battery life is ridiculously low, and nope you cant replace/swap the battery. Samsung decided they want you to buy a new phone when your battery starts to fail. I would have went with a different unit, but ATT charges to exchange for a different model, and there customer service is the worst Ive dealt with. Id recommend you explore the newest LG, or IPhone if you're going to get a new phone, this S6 is nothing special.",DJamez,Samsung_S6,649

Users from areas throughout the country cannot use the phone on the 4G LTE or Spark settings, there is rarely any reception and if there is, calls drop. Putting the phone on CDMA allows it to be used but at 3G. Both my husband and I saw this personally with our phones. Previously we had the S4 and had great reception, the only thing that changed was the phone. Other people posting have tested their phones along with friends with the S6 but on other carriers, and those phones did not have this problem. It appears that it is an issue with how Sprint/Samsung configured the phones being sold by Sprint. Sprint will not acknowledge or reply to the forum discussion, nor do their technicians appear to be informed of the problem. The phone itself is wonderful.",susan,Samsung_S6,650

2 of 2 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on September 11, 2015","Why I chose the Samsung Galaxy S6 over the Apple iPhone 6 First, let me make it clear that these were the only two phones I performed a detailed comparison of. There are many other credible phones that would make worthy competitors -- however I narrowed it down to these two at the time I made my purchase (June 2015). Additionally, these are my findings based on my use case. Obviously your use case may be different. Given the difficultly of performing an objective and scientific A/B test for all the categories that were important to me, I've also provided links to objective technical analysis performed by credible engineering labs and other sources throughout my review below. You may have to copy/paste the links into the url of your browser. While I double checked the technical specs, don’t hesitate to make me aware of any technical spec errors if you see any. SCREEN TO BODY RATIO – Samsung Wins: I intentionally chose to start with this characteristic of the two phones given that I rarely see it mentioned in the many reviews I've read (users, technical journalist, etc.) -- and this really bothered me about the Apple device. Apple's iPhone 6 struck me as being stuck in the ancient past (in relative Smartphone years) with huge bezels (top, bottom and side) as compared to the svelte futuristic look and feel of the Samsung Galaxy S6. Samsung's exterior design really showcased it's outstanding screen by minimizing the size of the bezels -- it looks much more futuristic and modern than Apple's phones. Considering the Samsung Galaxy S6 packs a larger battery, along with other much more impressive hardware specs, this is an amazing accomplishment. BATTERY ENDURANCE – Samsung Wins: Almost all Smartphone users complain about the duration of their battery. It's certainly a valid concern - and one not to take lightly when choosing your phone. You've heard the saying regarding which camera is the best -- it's the one you're carrying. Well, for batteries it seems to be the opposite -- from a user's perspective the worst battery seems to always be the one in the Smartphone you're carrying. The link below provides an excellent analysis for battery comparison that supports my observation that Samsung’s Galaxy S6 battery holds up longer than the Apple iPhone 6 battery (there are many others with the same or similar conclusion). You may need to add the two phones using PhoneArena’s drop down box as they are adding new phones all the time. http://www.phonearena.com/news/Galaxy-S6-edge-battery-life-benchmark-results-show-better-performance-than-the-Note5_id72736 Samsung’s Galaxy S6 includes a 2550 mAh battery, while Apple’s iPhone 6 includes an 1810 mAh battery. While neither of these batteries will set any endurance records, PhoneArena rates the Apple iPhone 6 battery as ‘Poor’ – while rating the Samsung Galaxy S6 battery as ‘Good’. The categories, best to worse, are ‘Excellent’, ‘Good’, ‘Average’, ‘Poor’. To be sure, some legacy Samsung users have complained about Samsung's decision to exclude a user replaceable battery in the Galaxy S6. However, my review isn't a comparison of the Galaxy S6 to previous Samsung flagship Smartphones. Instead, I'm directly comparing it to the Apple iPhone6. BATTERY CHARGING – Samsung Wins: Reference the same link above for an objective and detailed comparison of battery charging performance. Based on PhoneArena’s analysis, even with the larger battery, the Samsung Galaxy S6 charges almost twice as fast as the Apple iPhone 6. Samsung's Galaxy S6 supports quick charge - and, with built-in wireless charging, the S6 supports the two top wireless charging standards. In my use case, given that I work in an assigned office, wireless charging is very convenient. I use the TechMatte Qi wireless charging pad (purchased on Amazon) and find it to be very reliable and consistent with the E.C.L. USA Crystal Clear Ultra Slim case (also purchased on Amazon). When I'm not using my Galaxy S6, I simple place it on the charging pad as",Amazon Customer,Samsung_S6,652

Install Flash Player I bought the Samsung Galaxy S6 directly through Verizon. Myself and my family tend to be Samsung users - smartphones, tablets, camcorders, Blueray players... so yes, I do have Samsung loyalty, yet I have to say the non-expandable internal memory is a bit of a bleah. I purposely got the 32GB as a) I am not one to fill up memory (never have been) and b) the extra hundred bucks for a 64GB seems ludicrous. Initial available memory is at approximately 22GB after all the updates... and the updates just keep coming, day in, day out. Some you can remove completely (if its listed under the APP windows, you can), rest you can disable, yet at times I have noticed there are ones that will suddenly re-activated and download the updates again. I have had this issue with my Samsung Tab 3 10.1"", too. When you plug the S6 into a PC (mine is Win 8.1 64Bit), you should be prompted to download and install a handler program for PC/S6 data transfers. I did get a very odd error though with some Amazon music tracks I transferred this way - standard MP3 format, but for some reason an error popped up as corrupted files. These were from two specific album collections (Instrumental Beats), yet the other album collections play fine. I can only assume it had something to do with the Samsung transfer software since I have the same tracks on multiple other Android devices, and never seen that error before. This can get quite warm with prolonged use. It gets a bit uncomfortable to the hand if no case is on. I currently use a UAG military-drop case, so it's no longer an issue. Strong, quick Bluetooth connections. Has NFC pairing - something I only discovered today while exploring the settings. Cool! The camera is great, of course, and the included photo editor is as robust as many Android Photo Editor I have evaluated. Fantastic display - fairs very well even in direct, bright sunshine. No problems with phone audio. I have to scratch my head in perplexity over other reviews say terrible reception. I can only guess it's a carrier-to-carrier issue? As for the ""bending"" complaint, that one also puzzles me. Yet I do have mine in a case, so perhaps that is the needful thing. Contact list includes Auto-Reject (something I had really wanted on my last phone) 4G support of credit card transactions. Has made my laptop home-visit repairs a better, more assured experience. ;) The aspect I personally love the most is the wireless charging - that is a pretty big plus in my book. The batter can dwindle relatively quickly, but by surrounding my self with wireless QI charging options (home, car travel, even a wireless charging power bank), it really is a moot thing. Standby time is strong; Samsung does shine in that respect. I hadn't known about the non-replaceable battery until after purchase... not sure how I feel about that. All in all, it's the slight doubt about only going with 32GB that bothers me, and I will burn the non-replaceable battery aspect bridge when I come to it down the line. Aside from that, I am quite pleased with this.",Tinfoot,Samsung_S6,653

I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. Samsung Galaxy S6 tries to be a revolutionary, but it is evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. So do check local specs. I played around with both S6 and S6 Edge for few days and my opinions are based on this. There are tons of reviews going into lot of details, so I am focused on few other aspects like what’s out there and how to compare specs. First Big Changes: No microSD or removable battery. I know many of you loyal Samsung fans says BUMMER! I was a die hard fan of Samsung till S4, then I went to LG G2/G3. I think this is the best bet for S6 to pull it off after a dismal year for Samsung last year. I was very curious to try out S6 and HTC One M9 as they are most talked about now. Many manufacturers are going away from microSD card slots and this is absolutely a must and is a key differentiator from iPhone. I am really sad Samsung decided to drop microSD card slot as well as no removable battery. Why?! Screen is a beauty on S6 – Just Gorgeous. Just go to a retail store and feel it! The Edge feature is still gimmicky. Unlike Note Edge, this has both sides so less dorky but still I am not sold yet. Unless you have loads of money, I will shy away from it for one more year and get it next year when they polish it up. It is certainly fancy and nice to show off, but I would rather buy an Android wear watch like Motorola 360 or Samsung Gear or LG R series. I like Motorola 360 but waiting for version 2 to appear. I like Round watches. IF YOU HAVE LAST YEAR model of any phone, PLEASE DON’T upgrade. Phones are becoming so standard and power packed it makes no sense to upgrade and waste money every year. I buy and sell so many phones as it is like a hobby for me, but I stick to one phone as primary for couple of years now. My main requirements are a 128 GB microSD, good screen, battery life and performance. I am trying hard to see if I can live without one. S6 and S6 Edge comes in a 128 GB variant and I will wait for prices to stabilize on this model. In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size, weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice.

4 of 5 people found the following review helpful,1,,"on September 1, 2015","My Verdict: My experience with this device was at first a positive one with a greatly-improved camera, a pretty snappy performance and lovely screen. It didn't take long for things to go downhill, and then, nuclear. The most important thing I can say after spending quite a lot of time with Samsung support via phone and chat is: are you in the mood to gather up several hundreds of dollars and burn them in front of yourself just for the hell of it? So, here's the best I can come up with about the new Galaxy phones: there are, or were, a number of unknowns due to the complete design and build changes, and Samsung is ready to blame customers with failed, failing and constantly-overheating phones (there seem to be a lot of those). And the carriers are more than happy to charge the customers for a new phone, and then play the blame game with Samsung and vice-versa (""Well, it's clearly a device issue"" vs. ""Speak to your carrier about how they're handling and shipping our devices"") in an endless loop of refurbished and flawed nightmares until your year's warranty (from time of the phone's manufacture, not the date of purchase!) is up. AT&T and Samsung both verbally smacked my palms for not having insurance, since then they would happily replace my 4-month old phone for just a few more hundred dollars! When a device is built like this so that air cannot escape as the processor rages on (and frankly, not much at all can be known about Samsung's chip given that it's not purchased by any other phone manufacturer and is new to this generation of Galaxies), any air trapped inside (and this would happen if not properly evacuated during the build sequence) causes the moisture in that air to condense and will discolor or corrode anything sealed inside the phone. Now, this explains the damage done, but certainly not how I could have caused it or could have prevented it. My Experience: After 4 months of owning the S6, what I now have is a ""water damaged/irreparable"" slab. Oh, it's important to note that I have received 3 of these phones as the first failed out of the box, received another that worked smoothly for about 6 wks, and then a replacement which, again, failed out of the box. I put a lot of confidence into the fact that my 3-year-old galaxy was still working, and that issues with the new design would be caught within year 1 (and that Samsung would be receptive to these potential issues). I was wrong, and please don't make the mistake of thinking that if you take incredibly good and gentle care of your phone and have had basically good experiences with Samsung in the past, that you can count on this device. Also, once Samsung has voided your warranty, your carrier probably will do absolutely nothing except offer to sell you another phone. At about 5-6 wks, the phone locked up during a podcast when I opened the camera, and sat there for about 20 minutes like a record skipping (screen unresponsive) while I looked into how to shut it down as nothing would work and I wasn't yet familiar with the soft reset for this device. Things went downhill from this point, and the phone gradually became buggier and more difficult, often shutting itself down and restarting 20 times in a day for no discernible reason, though any AT&T updates absolutely brought it to its knees. Most recently, a major AT&T update was the beginning of my device's end. It quite literally just broke down, shutting itself off, only able to remain on for about 45 seconds when I forced it to turn on again or after a soft reset. Any task I could open within that tiny window would prompt it to freeze and/or shut down. It never worked again. Fast forward through AT&T's lack of interest or response to the issues, even refusing to troubleshoot or actually to answer any simple questions I asked; instead, I was told that a warranty replacement needed to be ordered as the phone was clearly beyond help. I eventually said ""yes"" to this and the ""certified, like-new phone"" I received as a rep",zcoop,Samsung_S6,657

I don’t know about anyone else but every time I have to get a new cell phone, I feel it is almost as bad as going to buy a car. My S4 recently died and I was forced to get a new phone. I really wasn’t looking forward to it as I had an unlimited contract that as soon as I got a new phone, I would lose that plan since Verizon no longer lets you keep your plan. Since Verizon no longer sells the S4, I decided to go with the new S6 64 gig version and bought it directly from Verizon wireless. The phone itself looks similar in design to the S4 but a bit thinner overall and a bit longer with a slightly bigger screen. One of the trends for phone makers these days is to go with a solid body design with the battery not removable. I didn’t like the cheap plastic back on the S4 that chipped up over time but since I tend to keep a phone longer than two years, I don’t like a phone that I can’t open the back and change the battery if I need. In addition to that you can’t add any addition memory as there is no external SD card slot which wasn’t main reason I went with the 64 gig version as I don’t think the 100 cost difference is worth it. Locally the 32 gig was sold out and since I needed a phone, I decided to go with the 64 gig version. Some people may not mind these issues though, especially if you trade phones every couple years and don’t worry about changing batteries or adding more space for your apps. I am not sure why though that they didn’t make this waterproof like the S5 since it does have a one body design. To me, the phone really only has a few differences in how it operates, since both my S4 (recently updated) and this S6 uses Android 5. The main thing I do like with this phone is the ability to use your fingerprint instead of a password to unlock my phone. It is a great time saver and works pretty flawlessly. The phone screen is sharp and the phone is quick with my apps. This has a pretty good camera with a 16 MP camera which takes nice quality pictures and video, although I am not a big phone picture taker. The battery life for this is ok and since you are stuck with the battery or a case/power bank that you use to supplement it, it is what it is. I like the style of the phone it definitely feels less cheap than the plastic back design of the S4, but I do wish it had the flexibility of opening the back for changing batteries and for additional memory. It you like the style and design of the S4 and S5 and don’t mind the battery and storage issues, then this is just as nice and you will most likely like this phone. 4 stars.",JWINK,Samsung_S6,658

I will continue to update this review in the future. This review should be the similar to Galaxy S6 on other carriers such as Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile. Pros: - No more plastics and cheap material. Samsung is finally giving us the hardware that we've long desired. By far, the best designed Galaxy phone to date imo - 5.1 in, QHD Super AMOLED screen. The screen is absolutely gorgeous that it hurts my eyes a bit. I'm still adjusting to it. - 16MP Camera with Smart OIS and 5MP front camera. Very well specs, but even better in performance. In short, the best camera on any android phones. I cannot believe that the picture came out so well in low light environment. You have to try it yourself to believe how great these low light pictures come out. - Gorilla Glass 4 panels for front and back (reminds me of the iPhone 4 and Nexus 4). Gorilla Glass are known to be tough and scratch resistance. - Comes in various colors: White, black, gold, green, blue (US only get the white, black, and gold unfortunately) - Comes in 32, 64, or 128GB of built-in memory. (For the 32gb - 3.7gb is for system partition, 25.2 for data/apps/pictures) - Less of the TouchWiz’s gimmicky features like the eye scroll, eye away from the screen pause. So we will not be experiencing the same slowdown or low storage as we did with earlier versions. If the GS4/5 were all about the features, this phone is all about the design. I do like the camera app and how they add a ""close all"" into the recent screen. - Rapid charging (need to use this more to confirm their claim of 4hrs of battery in 10 minute charge - UPDATED 5/1/15 i am getting about 1 to 1 1/2 hrs of use after the 10 minute charge, I'm guessing the 4hr claim is idle??) - Wireless charging - So if you have extra money that you want to drop for a wireless charging dock, you will be able to use it with this phone. Cons (Not necessarily apply to everyone): - No removable back panel. - No removable battery. I’m a battery hog, so I’m always draining my battery by 3-4pm. Not being able to just swap out my battery will be a pain, but let’s wait to see if the battery swap will be needed in a month when I fully test this device. - Lower battery capacity - 2550mAh compared to the 2600mAh in GS4 and 2800mAh in GS5. With the new processor, battery usage should be more efficient so it should not be a big deal, but end-users would rather the capacity to increase than decrease (Will update if this make through a day of normal usage, UPDATED 5/1/15 - I'm getting average about 8-9 hrs of normal usage, not ideal but I'll manage) - No waterproofing like the GS5, but I never used a smartphone that was waterproofed before, so not a big issue ""to me"" - No ability to swap out memory card – Might bother some Galaxy fans, but with the higher memory options, I do not think this is a huge problem. - Still no on-screen navigation button – Might only be a problem for ""pure"" Android fan. - Rear Camera and Flash sticks out a bit and not flush with the back panel. - Front and back glass is a potential problem as we all experiences with iPhone 4 and Nexus 4. Glass will break if you drop your phone at the right angle regardless how much stronger it is, so ""case up"". - The 1 speaker at the bottom is louder, however when you turn it on max, you will get some distortions in the audio quality. - There are some apps on there that I prefer downloading myself rather than them pushing it on me. There are some Social apps or Microsoft apps included such as OneDrive, facebook, etc. I personally use these apps, but there are people who don't. - I have been experiencing some weird stutters/lags while messing around the phone. This might because I'm loading a bunch of apps into it right now. I will need a few more days to look into this. Overall, this feels like a this is a solid de",FrozenCloud,Samsung_S6,659
4 of 5 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 10, 2015","Wow, what a difference a year makes. While last year's S5 took many steps in the right direction(being somewhat waterproof with better material and craftsmanship), it still wasn't there to make it a mouth-watering phone yet, like what HTC did when they first introduced their One M7, or whenever Apple introduces a new iPhone size. This year, Samsung has finally learned from both of their competitors, and made a phone that has all the good qualities of both, plus some of their own. Finally, this is the Galaxy S that you've always wanted and been dreaming of. * LOOKS/FORM-FACTOR/MATERIALS: The very first thing you notice when you handle the phone, is its new design and form factor - finally Samsung has completed their transformation of getting rid of all that ugly plastic parts. Now it is just all glass and metal, and now it is truly beautiful. The metal fully wraps around the edges ofthe phone. The back is beautiful, the sides are beautiful - heck, even the buttons are beautiful. It feels great in the hand, and oozes style and sophistication. * SCREEN: The very next thing you notice, of course, is the screen. I am continually pleasantly surprised at the evolution of Samsung's AMOLED technology - it has now became the best screen in the industry, hands down. I used to defend the LCD technology of the HTC M7, and at that point it was in fact overall superior to the Samsung S4 because the AMOLED then had issues in the sun, and color reproduction(it was too saturated and not natural). But now, they have fixed those issues, and the S6's screen is just quite simply the best. If you don't believe it, just compare an LG/Samsung OLED TV to any LED TVs today. I still think 5.1 inches for a screen of a PHONE is still too big, but overall, for what smartphones represent nowadays, it is acceptable - we have conditioned ourselves to accept the bigger sizes of smartphones(I remember when I first held a 4.2"" smartphone when it first came out - the HTC HD2 - and thought, ""what the h3ll is this monstrosity??""). * It doesn't hurt that Samsung boosted up the resolution to 1440 x 2560 pixels, which is approximately 577 ppi in pixel density. Although this is quite overkill right now, it's always nice to have the latest and greatest technology - that's the reason why we buy these overpriced phones in the first place, isn't it? It is also very bright, and sunlit legibility is excellent. Color reproduction is quite accurate, and like the S5, you can choose different color modes to suit your liking. *BATTERY LIFE: An important aspect to discuss is the battery life, now more than ever because there is no removable back cover to make replacing the battery easily like before, not to mention there is no microSD slot for you to add memory space to your phone. Comparatively, the S6 Edge is supposed to last a little less than the S6 regular, which I've read is less than last year's S5. But I'm one of those who are always around a charger, and I always carry external battery packs in my backpack when I travel, so that's never a concern. Seriously, who even buys an extra battery anymore - which you can only use for a single specific phone model - when your external battery can charge ANY and ALL phones and tablets?? This scenario only makes sense if your work is so demanding that you don't have extra time to charge the phone, and need to swap batteries IMMEDIATELY. I don't think that scenario is realistic nowadays when external batteries are so small, light, and cheap. My S6 goes from 100% at 10 am to about 20% at 10 pm with moderate use - so no complaints there. I get home, plug it up, and there are no issues. * What's better this year, is the wireless charging standards are already built into the phone, so you can just buy a charging pad for about $50 and feel even more cool. * USER INTERFACE/SOFTWARE: The Samsung user interface called TouchWiz used to be bloated and sluggish. It would slow down(navigating throughout the phone, switching between apps, and using",Johnny Amazon®,Samsung_S6,660

1 of 1 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on July 14, 2015","The Galaxy S6 is an outstanding smartphone. Not to be confused with its sibling, the S6 Edge, it makes up for the lack of a touch screen that extends to the sides of the phone with its lower price. Otherwise the phones are identical in features and capabilities which are long and impressive. The screen, with is slightly larger than the S5, is bright and, to date, has the highest resolution of any smartphone and is extremely responsive with virtually no noticeable lag when touched. Although it does not have the Snapdragon processor, which is the fastest in the industry, it does have two slower quad-core processors working in tandem which gives the phone phenomenal speed and multitasking capabilities. The improvements added since the S5 are built-in wireless charging capabilities that meet the Q1 standard, Gorilla Glass 4, the latest shock resistant touch glass from Corning. The already impressive camera is improved with an increased aperture enabling a greater sensitivity to ambient light and much wider pictures to accompany a superb auto focusing system. And addressing the complaints of the S5's plastic case, the S6 has a thinner and lighter aluminum body. The thinner body also makes the S6 ideal for use with a protective case or shell. Lastly, the latest version of Android seems perfectly suited for each feature of the phone, especially the S6 Edge, making it more than a match for Apple's iPhone 6 in both speed and ease of use while exceeding it in capabilities and functionality. However, the S6 does have its drawbacks but they are few. Like the S4 and S5, the battery life is pretty much just below average, most likely due to supporting the twin processors and that bright, hi-res screen. But unlike the S4 and S5, the battery in the S6 is not removable so you can't upgrade it with an increased capacity aftermarket version. This is most like due to the wireless charging capability. Samsung claims to combat this issue with built-in power management software that can extend battery life, enable rapid charging and improve battery performance as it learns the characteristics of the battery in conjunction with your usage patterns. I can attest that the S6 does charge fairly quickly although slightly slower using wireless charging. And Q1 wireless charging can be a quirky since the power adapter must match the amperage and voltage of the Samsung S6 adapter precisely for it to work reliably. If you're intent on using wireless charging, I recommend using a Q1 charger with an extra Samsung S6 adapter. It also only has a single, although highly capable, speaker which is surprisingly loud considering its small size. Like the S5, the S6 delivers much better high fidelity stereo sound when using the speaker jack or a bluetooth speaker/headphone connection. Another drawback is that the S6 has no MicroSD card slot so you are limited to built-in memory. However, Samsung does offer three memory options (32, 64 and 128 GB) as opposed to the usual two (16 / 32 or 32 / 64 GB) which entail additional costs with each increase in memory (another reason to opt for an S6 with increased memory as opposed to an S6 Edge for the same price). Overall, the S6 is an excellent response from Samsung after the unimpressive sales performance of the S5. While the S6 Edge is definitely the best looking smartphone on the market, you may not find its side areas worth the added expense when compared to the normal S6. The regular S6, though, has the edge (no pun intended) over its more glamorous sibling simply because the additional money required to purchased an Edge can be used to increase the built-in memory which, in my opinion, will do more to extend the functional life of the phone giving you more room for applications and other software. I definitely consider this phone to be the best on the market to date and have no problem recommending it for anyone looking for a phone packed with features and capabilities.",JD91,Samsung_S6,668
1 of 1 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 27, 2015","?° ?? ?° I got a chance to test a Galaxy S6 out and immediately bought one for my wife. I'm a complete phone nerd (XDA Developers Recognized Contributor, if that means anything to you) so I massively over analyze these things. It's a VERY nice phone but it's got some things that I consider drawbacks. For my wife, all the drawbacks listed below were non issues. She didn't care about these issues. So understand that my 'drawbacks' are completely subjective to your personal needs. But they are things that you should be aware of and consider if they mean anything to you before purchasing. ?????THE UPSIDES????? ? The screen is incredible. Like really incredible. The resolution is better than my eye can see. I use a Galaxy S4 as my regular phone and it has great resolution where you can't see individual pixels. I thought the S4 screen was as good as you can get, but the S6 screen takes it to a whole new level. Even though you can't see pixels on either screen, the higher resolution of the S6 screen makes everything look so sharp that it's nearly impossible to tell you are looking at a screen. It's that incredible. ? The design of the phone just feels more 'expensive'. I mean that in a good way. It feels just higher quality than previous models in the Galaxy S line. The S3 and S4 for example are often critiqued for having a plastic shell. The S6 has a metal band around the outside that just makes it feel 'premium' in your hand. It should also provide more protection for the device as well. ? TouchWiz is HEAVILY scaled back. I hate TouchWiz (Samsung's version of Android) It adds a layer of UI that is neither helpful nor intuitive. And it's a resource hog which slows the phone down for important tasks just so it can make the scrolling smoother, and other such useless tradeoffs. On the S6 TouchWiz was barely noticeable. The UI looks more like the standard Google Android Lollipop interface. It was all just much smoother and simpler and better and wonderful. ? Camera. 16 MP. And the images it takes look stunning on the super HD screen. Those photos on a larger high resolution monitor are simply stunning. ?????THE DOWNSIDES????? ? The battery is not removable or easily replaceable. A cell phone battery has a life of about 500 charge cycles. I tend to keep my phones for 2 years as daily users, then I keep my old phones for a variety of other purposes around the house. (My old HTC Sensation is hooked up to my stereo for use as a nice wifi streaming media player with a touchscreen UI, for example) I eventually have a need to replace batteries because I wear them out. I like being able to go on Amazon, spent $20 on a replacement battery, pop it in and be done. Additionally, even if you don't keep your phones that long, batteries fail sometimes. The stock batteries on the Galaxy S4 had some problems. They were minimal, but for those affected the battery absolutely had to be replaced. On the S4 it took 8 seconds and the problem was solved. On the S6 I'm sure it would be covered by warranty but it'd be a pain to take it somewhere to have it worked on should the issue come up. So no replaceable battery is a deal killer for me. This might not be an issue for you. If not, great! But be aware of the issue before making purchase decisions. ? You can't expand the storage with an SD Card. I don't want to live in the cloud. I hate the cloud. Sometimes I'm not on an LTE network. Sometimes I'm in the middle of nowhere but still want to show someone pictures of my kids. I got my wife the 32GB model. That sounds like a lot, but keep in mind that some of that is dedicated for the operating system and user apps. So you don't get to use all 32GB. This model is a 128GB model, which greatly limits my problem with not liking the cloud option. But it's still worth noting. Again, you might not care. If not, great! My wife doesn't keep a lot of stuff on her phone. She moves all her pictures to her computer and never loaded video to watch on her phone, so the storage ",Obi Wan,Samsung_S6,669
1 of 1 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 10, 2015","For readers, my opinions on this device (ATT 32Gb version) is based off the experiences I had with this device for the passed few hours as today is launch day (April 10, 2015). I will continue to update this review in the future. This review should be the similar to Galaxy S6 on other carriers such as Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile. Pros: - No more plastics and cheap material. Samsung is finally giving us the hardware that we've long desired. By far, the best designed Galaxy phone to date imo - 5.1 in, QHD Super AMOLED screen. The screen is absolutely gorgeous that it hurts my eyes a bit. I'm still adjusting to it. - 16MP Camera with Smart OIS and 5MP front camera. Very well specs, but even better in performance. In short, the best camera on any android phones. I cannot believe that the picture came out so well in low light environment. You have to try it yourself to believe how great these low light pictures come out. - Gorilla Glass 4 panels for front and back (reminds me of the iPhone 4 and Nexus 4). Gorilla Glass are known to be tough and scratch resistance. - Comes in various colors: White, black, gold, green, blue (US only get the white, black, and gold unfortunately) - Comes in 32, 64, or 128GB of built-in memory. (For the 32gb - 3.7gb is for system partition, 25.2 for data/apps/pictures) - Less of the TouchWiz’s gimmicky features like the eye scroll, eye away from the screen pause. So we will not be experiencing the same slowdown or low storage as we did with earlier versions. If the GS4/5 were all about the features, this phone is all about the design. I do like the camera app and how they add a ""close all"" into the recent screen. - Rapid charging (need to use this more to confirm their claim of 4hrs of battery in 10 minute charge - UPDATED 5/1/15 i am getting about 1 to 1 1/2 hrs of use after the 10 minute charge, I'm guessing the 4hr claim is idle??) - Wireless charging - So if you have extra money that you want to drop for a wireless charging dock, you will be able to use it with this phone. Cons (Not necessarily apply to everyone): - No removable back panel. - No removable battery. I’m a battery hog, so I’m always draining my battery by 3-4pm. Not being able to just swap out my battery will be a pain, but let’s wait to see if the battery swap will be needed in a month when I fully test this device. - Lower battery capacity - 2550mAh compared to the 2600mAh in GS4 and 2800mAh in GS5. With the new processor, battery usage should be more efficient so it should not be a big deal, but end-users would rather the capacity to increase than decrease (Will update if this make through a day of normal usage, UPDATED 5/1/15 - I'm getting average about 8-9 hrs of normal usage, not ideal but I'll manage) - No waterproofing like the GS5, but I never used a smartphone that was waterproofed before, so not a big issue ""to me"" - No ability to swap out memory card – Might bother some Galaxy fans, but with the higher memory options, I do not think this is a huge problem. - Still no on-screen navigation button – Might only be a problem for ""pure"" Android fan. - Rear Camera and Flash sticks out a bit and not flush with the back panel. - Front and back glass is a potential problem as we all experiences with iPhone 4 and Nexus 4. Glass will break if you drop your phone at the right angle regardless how much stronger it is, so ""case up"". - The 1 speaker at the bottom is louder, however when you turn it on max, you will get some distortions in the audio quality. - There are some apps on there that I prefer downloading myself rather than them pushing it on me. There are some Social apps or Microsoft apps included such as OneDrive, facebook, etc. I personally use these apps, but there are people who don't. - I have been experiencing some weird stutters/lags while messing around the phone. This might because I'm loading a bunch of apps into it right now. I will need a few more days to look into this. Overall, this feels like a this is a solid de",FrozenCloud,Samsung_S6,670

I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. Samsung Galaxy S6 tries to be a revolutionary, but it is evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. So do check local specs. I played around with both S6 and S6 Edge for few days and my opinions are based on this. There are tons of reviews going into lot of details, so I am focused on few other aspects like what’s out there and how to compare specs. First Big Changes: No microSD or removable battery. I know many of you loyal Samsung fans says BUMMER! I was a die hard fan of Samsung till S4, then I went to LG G2/G3. I think this is the best bet for S6 to pull it off after a dismal year for Samsung last year. I was very curious to try out S6 and HTC One M9 as they are most talked about now. Many manufacturers are going away from microSD card slots and this is absolutely a must and is a key differentiator from iPhone. I am really sad Samsung decided to drop microSD card slot as well as no removable battery. Why?! Screen is a beauty on S6 – Just Gorgeous. Just go to a retail store and feel it! The Edge feature is still gimmicky. Unlike Note Edge, this has both sides so less dorky but still I am not sold yet. Unless you have loads of money, I will shy away from it for one more year and get it next year when they polish it up. It is certainly fancy and nice to show off, but I would rather buy an Android wear watch like Motorola 360 or Samsung Gear or LG R series. I like Motorola 360 but waiting for version 2 to appear. I like Round watches. IF YOU HAVE LAST YEAR model of any phone, PLEASE DON’T upgrade. Phones are becoming so standard and power packed it makes no sense to upgrade and waste money every year. I buy and sell so many phones as it is like a hobby for me, but I stick to one phone as primary for couple of years now. My main requirements are a 128 GB microSD, good screen, battery life and performance. I am trying hard to see if I can live without one. S6 and S6 Edge comes in a 128 GB variant and I will wait for prices to stabilize on this model. In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size, weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don’t advertise or mention SAR prominently. phone parameters: {size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR rating} Samsung Galaxy S6: 5.65 x 2.78 x 0.27 in, 138 gm, 1440 x 2560 pixels, 5.1 in, 577 ppi, 3 GB RAM, NO MICROSD SLOT (bummer), Internal Storage upto 128 GB, Exynos 7420 Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2.1 GHz Cortex-A57, Gorilla Glass 4, 16 MP/5MP camera, SAR 1.15 W/kg (head), 1.16 W/kg (body) NANO SIM Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge: Slightly lower dimensions, 0.01 in thicker, 6 gm less weight, Same resolution, Curved Screen, HTC One M9: 5.69 x 2.74 x 0.38 in, 157 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 3 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 20.7 MP (rear), 4 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 810, Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2 GHz Cortex-A57 Samsung Galaxy S5: 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 in, 145 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.1 in, 432 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, MSM8974-AC Processor: Quad core, 2500 MHz, Krait 400, 0.63 W/kg (head), 0.82 W/kg (body) HTC One M8: 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 in, 160 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 4 MP (rear), 5 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, Quad core, 2300 MHz, Krait 400, 0.94 W/kg (head), 0.83 W/kg (body) LG G3: 5.76 x 2.94 x 0.35 in, 149 gm, 2560 x 1440 pixels, 5.5 in, 538 pp",rpv,Samsung_S6,671
16 of 23 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 10, 2015","*Just a quick disclaimer: I just got this phone today at BestBuy and Ive been playing with it for a lot of time nonstop. So far the experience is great and nearly perfect. I encountered no stutters, no lag, no glitches, nothing. I downloaded a couple graphically intensive games and it ran all of them very well. And all in all navigating through the Touchwiz UI was surprisingly smooth, something that I wish I could've complimented in the past Samsung phones. Right now the battery is at 31 percent for me.* Oh god this phone is a masterpiece. Let me just start out by saying that I've had the S5 for about 6 months now. I've mostly liked the phone. I liked it's dependable battery life, it's water and dust resistance, it's gorgeous display, etc. But I felt like some things about it were just a deal breaker. The Touchwiz UI was no better than looking in a trash can. It was slow to respond and had these peculiar bleeps and bloop sounds that were rather annoying than adding something convenient. The air gestures were dope to use first but it quickly got useless. The settings were a total mess and it left a sour taste to a myriad of users including me. I'm most defenitely not the person who will hate any phone because it is made out of plastic and love the other because it has metal, but I did like a well built phone. It's not like I would hate a plastic phone but the S5 did have a better design than the S4, but it still wasn't good. It was an improvement but not one that I loved holding instantly when I picked it up unlike HTC phones. All in all, the S5 wasn't for everyone. Then I saw this phone at MWC 2015. I didn't go the the event but I did watch some videos of this phone at the event. I saw that the S6 had better design, it was made out of glass, it had no expandable storage or battery replacement option, the Touchwiz UI was less ""Touchweezy"" and much cleaner and faster, it had much better specs inside, and there was an S6 edge version. I knew that the S6 was a phone that I've wanted from Samsung long time but I had to experience it firsthand to believe it. So I brought this phone Day 1 from Best Buy, and I have to say, this phone is almost everything that I've wished for. Pros: -Very premium to hold. There is actual metal around the edges, not just shiny plastic and the back is made out of glass, just like the Nexus 4. -The display is the best out of any phone in the market at the moment (4/10/15). Samsung upgraded the display from 1080p to 1440p. This makes it sharper and clearer, but you won't notice the difference that much side by side unless you look close. Also, in traditional Samsung fashion, the phone has great colors, excellent contrast ratio, etc. -Touchwiz UI is cleaner and better than ever. The whole UI seems fast and fluid, especially since it's running on Android 5.0 Lollipop. Some of the features like Air Gesture are no longer there in the settings. It looks flatter. -Great performance. Samsung ditched Qualcomm for their processors in their phone now and they decided to put their well known Exynos processor inside this phone. They also put 3 GB of DDR4 Ram now. The result is a beastly phone that does almost anything you throw at it. Graphically intensive games run very well even at high settings and everyday tasking is smooth. Runs like a beast. -Very fast to charge. I had the battery at 21% and charged it for 30 minutes and it instantly went up to 93%. -Camera has less noise on low light pictures and there is OIS now. Cons: -Not IP67, meaning its not dust proof or water resistant. It would've been nice if they still kept that extra protection from the S5 to this phone, but I haven't dropped a phone in the water for nearly a decade, so this isn't a huge problem for me. -Battery is not replacable. Its quite a sad thing for Samsung to cut down, since most of their old phones had this feature. If your battery is dead, then too bad, you have to either go to an Electronics support store and get it fixed or buy a new phon",Ryan,Samsung_S6,672
3 of 4 people found the following review helpful,3,,"on August 8, 2015","I'm neither Pro-Apple or Pro-Android, I'm simply pro-what works best for me. I had the S6 for one day, and that was long enough for me to figure out I wouldn't be happy with it for two years. My first tablet was a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. I'd heard Samsung's Touchwiz had been improved upon since then, but as far as I'm concerned they didn't improve upon it enough. The device still comes pre-loaded with tons of useless apps.. some of which you can uninstall (and I did), but a great deal you're stuck with. I spent quite a few hours disabling apps and attempting to optimize the user experience to fit my needs. I was running an extremely basic (non-power user) setup, and I still had between 60-85% of my RAM being used up by all the processes running in the background. It doesn't matter if you don't use ""S Health"" or disable their weather app because you'd rather use another.. there's always going to be a bunch of unnecessary junk hogging your phone's resources, unless you void the warranty and root the device. What's the point of having 3GB of RAM if you can't make the most of it? I got over 5 hours of screen time and 10-11 hours total use before charging again--with 19% remaining--so the battery performed well on day one. It doesn't seem to do very good with standby time, though. My iPhone 5C and iPad Air 2 are capable of going for days on standby, and I can tell that wouldn't be the case with the S6. I wanted this phone for its camera. I've seen many fantastic photos shot with the S6 on Flickr and elsewhere. The results I got from the few test photos I took didn't impress me as much I thought they would, but this is a solid smartphone cam and one of the best you can find on the market right now. The display is also fantastic and one of the brightest I've seen. I had the brightness set at about 15-20% last night and it was still plenty bright. The music I was streaming via Rhapsody and bluetooth in the car was occasionally cutting out last night. This has never happened on my iPhone, so it's not a good sign to be experiencing playback issues with the S6 on the first day. Scrolling through websites and white in the Play Store seemed a bit jittery at times. And as far as the Android app selection is concerned, I guess how good the selection is all comes down to what your needs are. If you're someone like me who's into creative fields like design, photography and music, the iOS App Store is still miles ahead of the competition. So I'm sticking with my 16GB 5C for now. I've had it for almost two years and could probably count on two hands how many times I've dealt with app crashes and system restarts. It still gives me good battery life, charges in about an hour, and new iPhones are just around the corner, so I guess I'll see what Apple has to offer in September. Bottom line: Samsung still doesn't know how to make the most of an Android OS.",C.E.,Samsung_S6,673
3 of 4 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 12, 2015","This year, Samsung kept everything much more simple, intuitive, and beautiful. As a result, the Galaxy S6 is the best smartphone any person can currently. My review will focus on 3 key aspects: exterior design and materials, tech specs and hardware performance, and interface and ui. I will also point out outstanding and new features along the way. Exterior Design: Although at first the Galaxy S6 may not look completely different from the Galaxy S5, it is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor. The 2 sheets of Gorilla Glass 4 adorning the front and back make the phone feel extremely premium, resolving common complaint about the previous generation. It has a full metal band surrounding it, rather than a faux plastic one. Now, the feel in hand is comparable to the iPhone 6, and the design is elegant while familiar. Since the phone is so thin at 6.8 mm, the camera module protrudes slightly from the chassis, however it does not affect the phone. There is a sapphire lens to protect the camera, but placing the phone in a case should alleviate the protruding camera issue. Going to the front. there is a typical rectangular home button with a recent apps capacitive key on the left, with a back key on the right. Overall, the Galaxy S6 is the best phone Samsung has ever designed; however, the sealed battery and absence of a micro SD card slot may upset many. I do not replace the batteries in my phone nor add SD cards for storage, but customers from the Galaxy devices before may be unhappy. Tech Specs, Hardware Performance, Notable Features: The Galaxy in real life and on paper is a monster! Screen: It packs an amazing 5.1 Super AMOLED screen with a resolution of 2560x1440. The screen is capable of bright whites and dark blacks, and is the best mobile display currently on the market. Although Super AMOLED screens tend to have overly saturated colors, choosing AMOLED Cinema mode in settings creates natural colors. Fingerprint Scanner: Instead of a swipe based sensor, the new fingerprint scanner embedded in the home button is a capacitive touch based sensor, like the one on the iPhone 6. All you do is place your finger on the home button to unlock the phone. You can set up a total of 4 fingers, and the sensor is extremely reliable and useful. Every person using this phone should have the fingerprint sensor turned on since it provides good security while being intuitive to use. Camera: The camera is a 16 megapixel sensor with OIS. The Galaxy S6 has the best camera out of all Android phones, and easily competes with the iPhone 6 Plus. Because of the higher resolution, images are extremely detailed. The Optical Imaging Stabilization ensures pictures are clear, while videos are buttery smooth. The OIS also helps at night, as the sensor can pull in more light without creating a blurry image. The result is an amazing camera that can produce vibrant and beautiful pictures during the day, and a camera that can create accurate and bright pictures at night. The camera is also capable of 4K video recording, and slow motion video as well. An important new feature the Galaxy S6 incorporates is the double click on home button to activate. When you double click the home button, it opens the camera in less than 1 second! The ""just shoot"" mentality this camera gives its users is simply amazing and unmatched. For the pro users out there, the camera includes a professional mode that users can use to adjust ISO, white balance, and more settings. The front camera is 5 megapixels, and it is a strong front facing camera. Not much can be said about it, but it produces beautiful selfies and good colors, and is more than adequate for all users. Quick Charging and Wireless Charging: The Galaxy S6 is capable of adaptive quick charging using the charger supplied in the box. This charges the Galaxy S6 extremely fast; you can get about 4 hours of use only with 10 minutes of charging. The phone also supports other Qualcomm Quick Chargers. The Galaxy S6 also supports the",blublue,Samsung_S6,674

Usually when a new phone gets released, I will wait a few months to see what everyone else says. Let the developers work out the kinks. By the time they do, months have gone by and they are already talking about the next model. I think about it, and I begrudgingly decide to hold out for that one. And the process repeats. Boy am I glad I did not do that to myself this time. What can I say about the Galaxy S6? The physical design is thought out and well balanced in the hand. At first glance it doesn't look like anything groundbreaking. And in my opinion, it's really not. But that's not a bad thing Samsung didn't break any new ground. What they did do was polish everything up. If my Galaxy S4 were a car and I took it to a detailer to get cleaned and waxed, the Galaxy S6 would drive out the other end. That's basically what this is all about. It's the greatest hits of the Galaxy and the iPhone in one device. Screen - Sharp crisp display, gives the iPhone6 a run for it's money. My eyes aren't good enough to even begin to appreciate this screen Battery - I'm one of those people who disables every app to get the last few percentage points out of my battery, no need to with this. I can get 7-8 hours easy - As a bonus, this charges very fast. Expect about 50% charge in 30 minutes Camera - Probably one of the biggest improvements. Autofocus makes taking nice clear pictures a breeze. - Some cool new features such as ""slow mo"" video and Virtual shot camera modes Fingerprint reader - Very responsive and not clunky like I was expecting Software - Some different menus but no major changes. Less bloatware and gimmicky apps that usually get included. Everything is streamlined - Very minimal drain on battery from background apps. Not sure if that is because of Samsung or Lollipop Speed - Run as many apps as you want. The processing power is incredible. - Transitions are smooth and there's a nice flow to the user experience Overall, this is a great phone and I am happy with my purchase. Samsung has finally taken the greatest hits of every other phone and put it all into one device. If you're one of those people who hang around on the fence like me waiting for the next model, take a chance on the S6. You won't regret it",T.J.,Samsung_S6,675

Saving this phone from 1 star, is the wireless charging. At an added expense I have a plantronics ledgend (bluetooth earpiece) and three wireless chargers where I can leave my phone (at my bedside, kitchen, and in my office) that makes the whole battery challenge a non issue except when I am traveling. I spend less than 1 hour on the phone, and 1 hour accessing applications and then I am ok for the day, but anything more than that and I need to charge at or before dinner. No GPS or Wi-Fi usage, thats just phone and apps. Looking at the battery information to see where it is going, the percentages don't' add up to 100% (often not even 70%), if there is an offending application I can't see where the battery power is going, if there is not then the hardware or android is using it.

I am a phone phonetic and always switch to latest and greatest phone and other gadgets. My last three phones that I personally used are S4, S5 and IPhone 6 Plus all on Verizon network.

But now, Samsung has finally caught up to Apple with the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge, which has a curved display on both sides. Actually, make that surpass Apple, because these two glass-and-metal phones seriously bring it out. Want to switch from IPhone. That's not the only reason to potentially drop your iPhone -- or upgrade your aging Android. the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge both sport faster, brighter and smarter cameras (16 MP on the back, 5 MP up front); a speedy octa-core Exynos processor (at least for the international version); and a 5.1-inch quad HD display. Plus, there's wireless charging built in as stated in Spec above. Color Choices for the family: the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge actually look different based on how they reflect light. Samsung added a reflective structure to the Gorilla Glass 4.0 back to bring out more color. Depending on how you hold it. I like this feature CGalaxy S6 in include a bold Topaz Blue, White Pearl and Gold Platinum. The curved S6 Edge has a sleek Emerald Green option in addition to black, white and gold. Between the metal frame and Gorilla Glass front and back, the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge feel solid but not slippery. The bottom edge looks a little too much like the iPhone 6 for my taste, as the headphone jack, charging port and speaker grilles are all in the same position, but it still looks good phone to get. Mobile Payments: Just like Apple try to do their thing. The Galaxy S6 will support Samsung Pay during the second half of the year, which will be compatible with both magnetic secure transmission (MST) and NFC for mobile payments. This means you should be able to use the S6 and S6 Edge at a wide range of retailers -- certainly more than Apple Pay with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus apparently. Samsung says payments will be secured via Samsung Knox, fingerprint scanning and advanced tokenization. Lets see how this will work. » Key Feature I don't like about this phone: No removal battery/ MicroSD slot - I always admire Phones that have removal batteries. Just like apple try to eat consumer money. Samsung is becoming smarter and decided to drop it on us. It's important to note that the S6 and S6 Edge lack both a microSD Card slot for expansion and removable back panel and battery. Little good news is that the S6 starts with 32GB of memory. Yea, they had to do that to keep up with Apple. No more water proof model: Galaxy S6 will not be water resistant, At least you won't have to worry about the S5's annoying microUSB power flap. A lot of owners wound up tearing it off like myself. »»» Bottom line: »»» Will I recommend this Phone: Yes I only had it for",Mr. B,Samsung_S6,678

I will continue to update this review in the future. This review should be the similar to Galaxy S6 on other carriers such as Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile. Pros: - No more plastics and cheap material. Samsung is finally giving us the hardware that we've long desired. By far, the best designed Galaxy phone to date imo - 5.1 in, QHD Super AMOLED screen. The screen is absolutely gorgeous that it hurts my eyes a bit. I'm still adjusting to it. - 16MP Camera with Smart OIS and 5MP front camera. Very well specs, but even better in performance. In short, the best camera on any android phones. I cannot believe that the picture came out so well in low light environment. You have to try it yourself to believe how great these low light pictures come out. - Gorilla Glass 4 panels for front and back (reminds me of the iPhone 4 and Nexus 4). Gorilla Glass are known to be tough and scratch resistance. - Comes in various colors: White, black, gold, green, blue (US only get the white, black, and gold unfortunately) - Comes in 32, 64, or 128GB of built-in memory. (For the 32gb - 3.7gb is for system partition, 25.2 for data/apps/pictures) - Less of the TouchWiz’s gimmicky features like the eye scroll, eye away from the screen pause. So we will not be experiencing the same slowdown or low storage as we did with earlier versions. If the GS4/5 were all about the features, this phone is all about the design. I do like the camera app and how they add a ""close all"" into the recent screen. - Rapid charging (need to use this more to confirm their claim of 4hrs of battery in 10 minute charge - UPDATED 5/1/15 i am getting about 1 to 1 1/2 hrs of use after the 10 minute charge, I'm guessing the 4hr claim is idle??) - Wireless charging - So if you have extra money that you want to drop for a wireless charging dock, you will be able to use it with this phone. Cons (Not necessarily apply to everyone): - No removable back panel. - No removable battery. I’m a battery hog, so I’m always draining my battery by 3-4pm. Not being able to just swap out my battery will be a pain, but let’s wait to see if the battery swap will be needed in a month when I fully test this device. - Lower battery capacity - 2550mAh compared to the 2600mAh in GS4 and 2800mAh in GS5. With the new processor, battery usage should be more efficient so it should not be a big deal, but end-users would rather the capacity to increase than decrease (Will update if this make through a day of normal usage, UPDATED 5/1/15 - I'm getting average about 8-9 hrs of normal usage, not ideal but I'll manage) - No waterproofing like the GS5, but I never used a smartphone that was waterproofed before, so not a big issue ""to me"" - No ability to swap out memory card – Might bother some Galaxy fans, but with the higher memory options, I do not think this is a huge problem. - Still no on-screen navigation button – Might only be a problem for ""pure"" Android fan. - Rear Camera and Flash sticks out a bit and not flush with the back panel. - Front and back glass is a potential problem as we all experiences with iPhone 4 and Nexus 4. Glass will break if you drop your phone at the right angle regardless how much stronger it is, so ""case up"". - The 1 speaker at the bottom is louder, however when you turn it on max, you will get some distortions in the audio quality. - There are some apps on there that I prefer downloading myself rather than them pushing it on me. There are some Social apps or Microsoft apps included such as OneDrive, facebook, etc. I personally use these apps, but there are people who don't. - I have been experiencing some weird stutters/lags while messing around the phone. This might because I'm loading a bunch of apps into it right now. I will need a few more days to look into this. Overall, this feels like a this is a solid de",FrozenCloud,Samsung_S6,679

I have a Samsung blu-ray player and it’s a very good blu-ray player. I have a Samsung Tablet and it is a great tablet. What the heck does this have to do with a Galaxy S6 Smart Phone review? Please keep reading I promise you won’t be sorry. First of all I just wanted to show that I am not a first time smart phone buyer nor first time galaxy buyer. As I said I had the S4 my wife’s S3 took a dump so I reluctantly gave her my S4 and bought an S6. I had the new S6 phone for almost a week. It has some great new features particularity the ability to keep the phone from locking when connected to anything in the exclusion list. Why is this important to me, it’s because I use my phone for work 99% - I work 100% remotely from home I am on it all day every day. Anyway, I quickly realized that most of the new features, why I liked this new phone, worked intermittently at best. I soon noticed I was dropping almost every call I made, the phone just seemed to be cursed. So, I took it back to where I bought it and they gave me a new one thinking I just got a bad phone. I was very skeptical and thought it was the new designed phone, crappy design and even worse mother boards. That Samsung had laid an egg with this new phone. Well, I was right!!!! This second phone acted and did the same thing. The battery lasts for like 30 minutes (being facetious) not too far off! The new features continued to act the same way, worked intermittently at best and the phone just seemed to be cursed. So, I called Samsung and this is where things get interesting. I worked with tech support and they couldn’t fix it they said send it in so we can fix it. I sent it in and within a week I had the phone back but I quickly noticed it was not zeroed out to factory settings as they said it would be. And there was no follow up call or e-mail or anything in the ticket online to say what they found. So, I called them and they told me “it has water damage” we can’t fix it!?!?!?!?!?! WTF!?!?!?!? Guys I’m telling you, I have used two of the phones now both brand new out of the box and they quite simply in short SUCK! I will now come across as a disgruntled customer spewing silly rhetoric but I don’t care. What I am saying is all true and if my phone really had water damage then the serial number sticker I specifically left stuck to the back of the phone would surely have water damage, it does not. I DID NOT CAUSE WATER DAMAGE TO MY PHONE. I pleaded with Samsung to replace my phone and they said they would talk to their supervisor and call me back. Well, you guessed it no call back after a week so far. I was involved with the first Pentium PC processors when they first came out, the company I worked for got a bad first batch and the big blue company that made them and installed them had to replace about 150 mother boards from that first batch. IT does happen. DO NOT BUY THE S6, you will be sorry, especially if you use the phone for anything other than calls, texting or taking pictures. SAMSUNG LAID AN ABSOLUTE EGG WITH THIS NEW S6!!!",synwave7,Samsung_S6,680

Excellent clarity. It works great under direct sun light too. It's fast, very responsive. No lag. Call quality is excellent Finger print unlock features works very well. Much better than the S5 CONS: It's slippery - my wife dropped her 4 times the first day she got hers. Yikes. But it didn't break! I got her a case now... Battery life is not that great - and when you think about it, that's the most important aspect of a phone. Without power, it's useless. Example: it's 100% at bed time, by morning it's at 80%. I didn't use the phone that whole time as I was sleeping. I do not have alot of aps on the phone yet. ocation is turned off. I do have 2 emails synching, one is Yahoo and the other for work and it's set to synch every hour. Fully charged in the morning, I am down to 80% by noon. I check emails, FB in the AM then it sits on my desk mostly unused during work, other than a quick check at lunch. I used it some to check FB and and emails later and it was down to about 20% by 8 PM. My wife uses her phone more than me and gets similar numbers. My son today, at noon, was at 52%. He uses it alot as he plays various games. So in summary, it's a very nice phone in just about all aspects, except battery life. I took 2 stars off for this because that's the most important feature of a phone (call quality comes next); I DO NOT recommend the S6 if you are a heavy user.",walnut the dog,Samsung_S6,681

The hardware felt excellent, but after two years on pure Android with a Nexus 5, I just couldn't downgrade to the TouchWiz interface. I returned the phone and ended up with a Moto G 3rd Gen Black - 16GB instead. The hardware is certainly less-powered than the S6, but I find the overall experience so much better with the near-pure Android software. If this phone was offered with stock android (no Samsung or AT&T ""enhancements"") I'd be right back to the phone in a heartbeat. Sadly no option exists, so I took my business back to Motorola.",Andrew Ash,Samsung_S6,682

I bought the 64 gb and have 800 songs, including some apps, i have a total of 40 gigs left over; the phone is bloated with both companies apps. The camera sticks out, therefore if you want to have it naked (no case) than you are going to have to set it face down so as not to scratch the lens. The headphone jack is at the bottom, very annoying to say the least. Battery life is better than my S5, but charging the takes longer than the S5. Aesthetically speaking it is beautiful. Not a lot of hiccups with Touch Wiz and the sound coming from the speaker has GREATLY improved.",PA-C,Samsung_S6,683

The camera is the best I have seen on a cell phone and for what I do on a phone the 32gig will be more than sufficient so it doesn't matter that there is no card slot. I've only had the phone a couple of days but the battery life seems decent. The only thing I don't like about it is that the phone is ridiculously slick. It randomly slides off of any thing cloth so I am holding my breath (and the phone, tightly) until my case comes in tomorrow because I have 3 little people living in my house. So please, for your own sanity, order a case at the same time as the phone.",cnicolette,Samsung_S6,684

But never had so many with a new phone.) 1. no flashlight app 2. no direct dial widget (it always asks which number cant select one number to use) 3. screens do not circle through must go back and forth (really annoying if you have like 5 screens) 4. does not mute sounds when headphones plugged in (notifications, ring tones,etc..library anyone) 5. does not stay logged on to wifi reliably even with strong wifi signal 6.eats through my data plan like crazy 6. already running out of memory and ram (phones memory has a fair percent used up you cant touch like 8gb out of 32) 7. battery life has gotten worse and worse (like from fulll charge to 30% sitting in my purse for 3 hours and yes checked no third party apps doing this) 8. phone has started overheating 9. random issues with calls (like not going through of freezing) 10.face hits keypad when talking on phone (I have friends with this phone who have another list of issues I could add to this) To try and solve these issues I have had to install the following programs 1.flash light widget app 2. direct dial widget app (speeddial) 3. alternate launcher (nova launcher) 4. sound controller (sound about) 5. wifi connect app (wifi keep alive) 6.cleaner/speed up app (360 security) 7.batter saver (du battery saver) 8. data saver app (opera max) I have tried rebooting phone, wiping phone, cleaning cash, using it with and with out above apps, trying different ones, trying different combinations of apps listed, etc...reading numerous articles and message boards, watching a lot of youtube tips and tricks and so on.

,5,,"on July 26, 2015","This is a 5 star 3G phone but only a 3 star 4G LTE phone. It’s an excellent phone in many ways except for the strength of the 4G LTE connection on the Sprint Network. Most of the time I can only get 1 bar signal strength on a 4G LTE connection. I set my phone on 3G CDMA to be able to use it effectively. The issue with the strength of the 4G LTE connection has been known since the phone was release on April 2015. You can Google this topic to read more about it. I think one other phone carrier may also have this issue. I’ve had 4G LTE strength connectivity issues since I purchased this phone on April 2015. There were rumors on the Sprint forum that a forthcoming software upgrade would fix the problem. I waited patient for 3 months and just upgraded the system software for the 2nd time to Android 5.1.1 and the connectivity issue still have not be fixed as of late July 2015. There has been an additional carrier update, not operating system update, and the problem still have not be resolved. This problem must be very difficult to solve, otherwise it would have been fixed by now. When I’m on the interstate highway, I only get strong 4G LTE reception when I’m passing by a cellular tower. As soon as I’m a quarter mile away, the signal weakens significantly to 1 bar. My previous phone was an iphone5 and on that same stretch of highway, I would get strong 4G LTE connection for miles. At various locations around town I now get very weak 4G signal whereas I had relatively strong signal on the iphone5. I visited several Sprint stores to see if their display models get strong signals. The display models in all of the stores that I visited did get strong 4G LTE signal, but my phone also got strong signal in the store. I speculate that either the stores are located near cell phone towers or they have some type of signal booster device in the store. My work place has a cellular signal booster so I know that cellular signal strength can be increased by such a device. As soon as I traveled about a quarter mile from the store, the 4G LTE signal strength dropped off dramatically. Another issue that I have with the phone is the battery life. Initially, after setting up the phone, my battery was draining about 5% per hour. After much research, I found that I can extend the battery life significantly if I turn off Wi-Fi, location, and mobile data when not needed. Turning off mobile data really extends the battery life but it is an inconvenience to constantly turn it on and off as needed. My old iphone5 never required such battery management strategy. I amaze me how a premium flagship product can be released with such a major flaw. UPDATED REVIEW 08 26 2015 I just updated the system software and it solves the issue of the weak 4G LTE connection. My 4G LTE connection is now acceptable. The new system software update also appears to extend the battery life. I no longer have the turn off Mobile Data to extend the battery life.",RR2004,Samsung_S6,691
,5,,"on April 27, 2015","?° ?? ?° I got a chance to test a Galaxy S6 out and immediately bought one for my wife. I'm a complete phone nerd (XDA Developers Recognized Contributor, if that means anything to you) so I massively over analyze these things. It's a VERY nice phone but it's got some things that I consider drawbacks. For my wife, all the drawbacks listed below were non issues. She didn't care about these issues. So understand that my 'drawbacks' are completely subjective to your personal needs. But they are things that you should be aware of and consider if they mean anything to you before purchasing. ?????THE UPSIDES????? ? The screen is incredible. Like really incredible. The resolution is better than my eye can see. I use a Galaxy S4 as my regular phone and it has great resolution where you can't see individual pixels. I thought the S4 screen was as good as you can get, but the S6 screen takes it to a whole new level. Even though you can't see pixels on either screen, the higher resolution of the S6 screen makes everything look so sharp that it's nearly impossible to tell you are looking at a screen. It's that incredible. ? The design of the phone just feels more 'expensive'. I mean that in a good way. It feels just higher quality than previous models in the Galaxy S line. The S3 and S4 for example are often critiqued for having a plastic shell. The S6 has a metal band around the outside that just makes it feel 'premium' in your hand. It should also provide more protection for the device as well. ? TouchWiz is HEAVILY scaled back. I hate TouchWiz (Samsung's version of Android) It adds a layer of UI that is neither helpful nor intuitive. And it's a resource hog which slows the phone down for important tasks just so it can make the scrolling smoother, and other such useless tradeoffs. On the S6 TouchWiz was barely noticeable. The UI looks more like the standard Google Android Lollipop interface. It was all just much smoother and simpler and better and wonderful. ? Camera. 16 MP. And the images it takes look stunning on the super HD screen. Those photos on a larger high resolution monitor are simply stunning. ?????THE DOWNSIDES????? ? The battery is not removable or easily replaceable. A cell phone battery has a life of about 500 charge cycles. I tend to keep my phones for 2 years as daily users, then I keep my old phones for a variety of other purposes around the house. (My old HTC Sensation is hooked up to my stereo for use as a nice wifi streaming media player with a touchscreen UI, for example) I eventually have a need to replace batteries because I wear them out. I like being able to go on Amazon, spent $20 on a replacement battery, pop it in and be done. Additionally, even if you don't keep your phones that long, batteries fail sometimes. The stock batteries on the Galaxy S4 had some problems. They were minimal, but for those affected the battery absolutely had to be replaced. On the S4 it took 8 seconds and the problem was solved. On the S6 I'm sure it would be covered by warranty but it'd be a pain to take it somewhere to have it worked on should the issue come up. So no replaceable battery is a deal killer for me. This might not be an issue for you. If not, great! But be aware of the issue before making purchase decisions. ? You can't expand the storage with an SD Card. I don't want to live in the cloud. I hate the cloud. Sometimes I'm not on an LTE network. Sometimes I'm in the middle of nowhere but still want to show someone pictures of my kids. I got my wife the 32GB model. That sounds like a lot, but keep in mind that some of that is dedicated for the operating system and user apps. So you don't get to use all 32GB. This model is a 128GB model, which greatly limits my problem with not liking the cloud option. But it's still worth noting. Again, you might not care. If not, great! My wife doesn't keep a lot of stuff on her phone. She moves all her pictures to her computer and never loaded video to watch on her phone, so the storage ",Obi Wan,Samsung_S6,692
,5,,"on April 13, 2015","I'm own a Galaxy S5 and I too was skeptical when the Galaxy S6 was announced due to the sealed in battery and non expandable memory. Then I realized that while I owned the Galaxy S5 for a full year, I never even once replaced its battery. I also realized that I was only using 30 GB out of the 64 GB micro SD card I have had on my S5 for a year. Those two facts made the non replaceable battery and non expandable memory non issues for me. Now let's talk about the Galaxy S6. I was never bothered by the use of plastic on the previous models, but the new design lines are beautiful. The phone is a work of art. It feels lighter and thinner than the S5. The screen is the most beautiful on a smartphone. The new fingerprint sensor is a lot better and makes unlocking your phone much much faster and accurate. The speaker is louder than the GS5 and I like the fact that it's placed on the bottom right. I also like how the power button is now lower on the right side and that the volume rockers are two separate buttons. I haven't taken that many pictures with the rear camera, but it's a lot snappier and pictures are better than on the GS5. I love how much faster the camera starts and love that I can double tap the home button to launch the camera. . The front facing camera is amazing. No more bad selfies. I also like the fact that you can take a picture by touching the heart rate sensor. The whole phone is a lot faster and data transfer rates are also faster. Touchwiz is lighter and cleaner and Lollipop is a beautiful, fluid OS. Another great feature is fast charging. I was able to go from 0 to 100% battery in just a little over an hour. Who needs removable battery when you can recharge that quickly? The screen is so sharp, WOW! Anyway, this phone is a beast. I highly recommend it.",BearCub,Samsung_S6,693
,5,,"on April 13, 2015","I bought my 64gb White Sprint S6 on launch day, and having upgraded from an S3, I am thrilled with its performance. That said, it is not without its drawbacks. My least favorite thing about this phone is that in a dark room the LED's on the capacitive touch buttons are not linked to the screen brightness, and are absolutely blinding. I exchanged the white for the black sapphire and I find that the touch lights are much less noticeable, and the screen looks better with a darker bezel. This would not be a problem on the white model if you could simply turn down or turn off these backlights as you could on the S3, S4, and S5, but apparently in its effort to ""De-bloat"" the touchwiz interface, Samsung removed this option (and many other useful options) from the preferences menu. Hopefully this option will be restored in future updates (still hasn't been as of 5.1.1), as it is unlikely to be resolved through apps without first gaining root access. The stock alarm clock is even stripped in options; where you used to control the number and duration of ""snooze"" operations allowed, now you have only the option of 3x5 minutes. Most of the gimmicks of previous generations have been removed (ie S-beam, air-gestures, etc.), which for the most part is an improvement, and the majority of stock bloat apps can at least be disabled, if not removed. I went with the 64gb simply because the 32gb has only 23gb of usable space, which should be plenty for most people. but I prefer not to get near the limits. The wireless charging works great, even through a thick case (the water resistant Supcase). The other ""gimmicks"" of this generation are much more useful than in the past, the fingerprint reader works as it should, very fast and reliable, the heartrate monitor works great on the bare phone, but can be more difficult to use with a case on the white S6, works fine with the black phone since the light used to read your fingerprint doesn't reflect off of the phone as badly. Also, the ergonomics are flipped from my S3, which aligned the buttons with your fingers when holding the phone in the right hand, whereas the S6 has the buttons placed for holding the phone in the left hand, with your thumb on the volume rocker and your middle finger on the power button. Overall, after 3 months this is one of the most stable mobile devices I have ever used, the performance is extraordinary and its features continue to be useful and impressive.",Example: Mark Twain,Samsung_S6,694
,5,,"on April 10, 2015","Wow, what a difference a year makes. While last year's S5 took many steps in the right direction(being somewhat waterproof with better material and craftsmanship), it still wasn't there to make it a mouth-watering phone yet, like what HTC did when they first introduced their One M7, or whenever Apple introduces a new iPhone size. This year, Samsung has finally learned from both of their competitors, and made a phone that has all the good qualities of both, plus some of their own. Finally, this is the Galaxy S that you've always wanted and been dreaming of. * LOOKS/FORM-FACTOR/MATERIALS: The very first thing you notice when you handle the phone, is its new design and form factor - finally Samsung has completed their transformation of getting rid of all that ugly plastic parts. Now it is just all glass and metal, and now it is truly beautiful. The metal fully wraps around the edges ofthe phone. The back is beautiful, the sides are beautiful - heck, even the buttons are beautiful. It feels great in the hand, and oozes style and sophistication. * SCREEN: The very next thing you notice, of course, is the screen. I am continually pleasantly surprised at the evolution of Samsung's AMOLED technology - it has now became the best screen in the industry, hands down. I used to defend the LCD technology of the HTC M7, and at that point it was in fact overall superior to the Samsung S4 because the AMOLED then had issues in the sun, and color reproduction(it was too saturated and not natural). But now, they have fixed those issues, and the S6's screen is just quite simply the best. If you don't believe it, just compare an LG/Samsung OLED TV to any LED TVs today. I still think 5.1 inches for a screen of a PHONE is still too big, but overall, for what smartphones represent nowadays, it is acceptable - we have conditioned ourselves to accept the bigger sizes of smartphones(I remember when I first held a 4.2"" smartphone when it first came out - the HTC HD2 - and thought, ""what the h3ll is this monstrosity??""). * It doesn't hurt that Samsung boosted up the resolution to 1440 x 2560 pixels, which is approximately 577 ppi in pixel density. Although this is quite overkill right now, it's always nice to have the latest and greatest technology - that's the reason why we buy these overpriced phones in the first place, isn't it? It is also very bright, and sunlit legibility is excellent. Color reproduction is quite accurate, and like the S5, you can choose different color modes to suit your liking. *BATTERY LIFE: An important aspect to discuss is the battery life, now more than ever because there is no removable back cover to make replacing the battery easily like before, not to mention there is no microSD slot for you to add memory space to your phone. Comparatively, the S6 Edge is supposed to last a little less than the S6 regular, which I've read is less than last year's S5. But I'm one of those who are always around a charger, and I always carry external battery packs in my backpack when I travel, so that's never a concern. Seriously, who even buys an extra battery anymore - which you can only use for a single specific phone model - when your external battery can charge ANY and ALL phones and tablets?? This scenario only makes sense if your work is so demanding that you don't have extra time to charge the phone, and need to swap batteries IMMEDIATELY. I don't think that scenario is realistic nowadays when external batteries are so small, light, and cheap. My S6 goes from 100% at 10 am to about 20% at 10 pm with moderate use - so no complaints there. I get home, plug it up, and there are no issues. * What's better this year, is the wireless charging standards are already built into the phone, so you can just buy a charging pad for about $50 and feel even more cool. * USER INTERFACE/SOFTWARE: The Samsung user interface called TouchWiz used to be bloated and sluggish. It would slow down(navigating throughout the phone, switching between apps, and using",Johnny Amazon®,Samsung_S6,695

Pros: - No more plastics and cheap material. Samsung is finally giving us the hardware that we've long desired. By far, the best designed Galaxy phone to date imo - 5.1 in, QHD Super AMOLED screen. The screen is absolutely gorgeous that it hurts my eyes a bit. I'm still adjusting to it. - 16MP Camera with Smart OIS and 5MP front camera. Very well specs, but even better in performance. In short, the best camera on any android phones. I cannot believe that the picture came out so well in low light environment. You have to try it yourself to believe how great these low light pictures come out. - Gorilla Glass 4 panels for front and back (reminds me of the iPhone 4 and Nexus 4).

(For the 32gb - 3.7gb is for system partition, 25.2 for data/apps/pictures) - Less of the TouchWiz’s gimmicky features like the eye scroll, eye away from the screen pause. So we will not be experiencing the same slowdown or low storage as we did with earlier versions. If the GS4/5 were all about the features, this phone is all about the design.

Cons (Not necessarily apply to everyone): - No removable back panel. - No removable battery. I’m a battery hog, so I’m always draining my battery by 3-4pm.

2 of 3 people found the following review helpful,4,,"on April 16, 2015","This review is from the perspective of someone coming from the iPhone line to the Samsung S line. I'll be updating this review as time goes on to share what I notice. THE POSITIVE... ""The first things that I noticed about this phone were the beautiful display(still set as adaptive in settings) and the camera."" SCREEN: The display is visibly superior to the iPhone at first glance. This phone feels like the perfect bridge between the iPhone 6 and the 6+ in a way that improves visibility but maintains an appropriate size. I came from the iPhone5, so the jump in size was odd at first, but I quickly became accustomed to it. I decided to get a thin glass screen guard to preserve its integrity through my adventures. I have not done enough yet to comment any more on the screen quality, I'll be viewing more photographs and videos in the following weeks so that I have more to say. CAMERA: A lot of my friends who are into photography and the few photography professionals I know tend to rave about the quality of the camera on the iPhone, but as a person who has dabbled in the art for some time now I can honestly say I prefer shooting with the S6. The settings available in the native camera app are a good step towards professional shooting options. so far I have played around with most of the photo and video settings and am most impressed by the UHD film setting. The resolution is breathtaking on the 5.2in screen in a way that my computer monitor can't even approach(and I have a decent quality monitor). In terms of editing photos, I'm using Autodesk Pixlr, fantastic and quick... I'll be playing around with the camera a lot more moving forward. Not a perfect representation of the resolution quality, but I'll be posting some of the shots to https://instagram.com/das_luk/ All shots after April 16th will be taken with the S6 unless I include #DSLR. Check them out if you are curious. INTERFACE AND EASE OF USE: ""I should preface this with the fact that I'm a tech savvy individual, so there may be some bias, but I love Android so far."" The interface was clean, nothing in your face and it didn't feel like there was a lot of bloatware or unnecessary apps. The first thing I did was remove the Amazon widget and the Galaxy Essentials. Just hold and drag to delete and it's looking good. I'm currently using the ""Forest Theme"", free on the theme store, but I'll be designing my own theme in the near future. I'll add more on that later. Most of the apps I needed or wanted were already on the phone. I suppose some could consider this bloatware, but they were all widely used applications like Uber, Facebook, and various Google apps. Organizing apps and adjusting the interface is easy and intuitive. Within an hour the phone felt like it was mine. This could feel like a lot for an iPhone user, but there are a lot of features that go above and beyond IOS that are found natively on Android(widgets, sizing, themes, ect). Automatic brightness is on point. The phone never feels too bright or dim, I've used it in a wide variety of lighting One negative that I found is that there are not settings for the capacitive key lights. They don't adjust with the phones screen brightness, so they can feel bright and invasive in low lighting situations. They light up every time you touch the screen so it gets frustrating. I looked it up online to see if I was looking in the wrong place, but apparently Samsung removed the settings from the S6 after having it on the previous generations. There is a workaround with root modding that I will be trying, more on that later. The ability to customize the interface and basic functionality of Android is what convinced me to make the switch in the first place, as I play around with it more I'll provide updates. SPEED: ""Moving through the interface and apps feels very smooth and snappy."" I have yet to play any graphic intensive games yet, but so far, moving between apps, playing with photo and video, and multitasking, I have noticed the pho",Lukas Welinder,Samsung_S6,698
2 of 3 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 10, 2015","Wow, what a difference a year makes. While last year's S5 took many steps in the right direction(being somewhat waterproof with better material and craftsmanship), it still wasn't there to make it a mouth-watering phone yet, like what HTC did when they first introduced their One M7, or whenever Apple introduces a new iPhone size. This year, Samsung has finally learned from both of their competitors, and made a phone that has all the good qualities of both, plus some of their own. Finally, this is the Galaxy S that you've always wanted and been dreaming of. * LOOKS/FORM-FACTOR/MATERIALS: The very first thing you notice when you handle the phone, is its new design and form factor - finally Samsung has completed their transformation of getting rid of all that ugly plastic parts. Now it is just all glass and metal, and now it is truly beautiful. The metal fully wraps around the edges ofthe phone. The back is beautiful, the sides are beautiful - heck, even the buttons are beautiful. It feels great in the hand, and oozes style and sophistication. The S6 Edge is just so unique-looking - it is the most beautiful phone I've seen in a long time. And contrary to what people might say or what you might think, the two sloped edges are not awkward to handle, does not dig into your skin, and is not uncomfortable to grip. * SCREEN: The very next thing you notice, of course, is the screen. I am continually pleasantly surprised at the evolution of Samsung's AMOLED technology - it has now became the best screen in the industry, hands down. I used to defend the LCD technology of the HTC M7, and at that point it was in fact overall superior to the Samsung S4 because the AMOLED then had issues in the sun, and color reproduction(it was too saturated and not natural). But now, they have fixed those issues, and the S6's screen is just quite simply the best. If you don't believe it, just compare an LG/Samsung OLED TV to any LED TVs today. I still think 5.1 inches for a screen of a PHONE is still too big, but overall, for what smartphones represent nowadays, it is acceptable - we have conditioned ourselves to accept the bigger sizes of smartphones(I remember when I first held a 4.2"" smartphone when it first came out - the HTC HD2 - and thought, ""what the h3ll is this monstrosity??""). * It doesn't hurt that Samsung boosted up the resolution to 1440 x 2560 pixels, which is approximately 577 ppi in pixel density. Although this is quite overkill right now, it's always nice to have the latest and greatest technology - that's the reason why we buy these overpriced phones in the first place, isn't it? It is also very bright, and sunlit legibility is excellent. Color reproduction is quite accurate, and like the S5, you can choose different color modes to suit your liking. *BATTERY LIFE: An important aspect to discuss is the battery life, now more than ever because there is no removable back cover to make replacing the battery easily like before, not to mention there is no microSD slot for you to add memory space to your phone. Comparatively, the S6 Edge is supposed to last a little less than the S6 regular, which I've read is less than last year's S5. But I'm one of those who are always around a charger, and I always carry external battery packs in my backpack when I travel, so that's never a concern. Seriously, who even buys an extra battery anymore - which you can only use for a single specific phone model - when your external battery can charge ANY and ALL phones and tablets?? This scenario only makes sense if your work is so demanding that you don't have extra time to charge the phone, and need to swap batteries IMMEDIATELY. I don't think that scenario is realistic nowadays when external batteries are so small, light, and cheap. My S6 goes from 100% at 10 am to about 20% at 10 pm with moderate use - so no complaints there. I get home, plug it up, and there are no issues. * What's better this year, is the wireless charging standards are already built into th",Johnny Amazon®,Samsung_S6,699
4 of 6 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 12, 2015","This year, Samsung kept everything much more simple, intuitive, and beautiful. As a result, the Galaxy S6 is the best smartphone any person can currently. My review will focus on 3 key aspects: exterior design and materials, tech specs and hardware performance, and interface and ui. I will also point out outstanding and new features along the way. Exterior Design: Although at first the Galaxy S6 may not look completely different from the Galaxy S5, it is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor. The 2 sheets of Gorilla Glass 4 adorning the front and back make the phone feel extremely premium, resolving common complaint about the previous generation. It has a full metal band surrounding it, rather than a faux plastic one. Now, the feel in hand is comparable to the iPhone 6, and the design is elegant while familiar. Since the phone is so thin at 6.8 mm, the camera module protrudes slightly from the chassis, however it does not affect the phone. There is a sapphire lens to protect the camera, but placing the phone in a case should alleviate the protruding camera issue. Going to the front. there is a typical rectangular home button with a recent apps capacitive key on the left, with a back key on the right. Overall, the Galaxy S6 is the best phone Samsung has ever designed; however, the sealed battery and absence of a micro SD card slot may upset many. I do not replace the batteries in my phone nor add SD cards for storage, but customers from the Galaxy devices before may be unhappy. Tech Specs, Hardware Performance, Notable Features: The Galaxy in real life and on paper is a monster! Screen: It packs an amazing 5.1 Super AMOLED screen with a resolution of 2560x1440. The screen is capable of bright whites and dark blacks, and is the best mobile display currently on the market. Although Super AMOLED screens tend to have overly saturated colors, choosing AMOLED Cinema mode in settings creates natural colors. Fingerprint Scanner: Instead of a swipe based sensor, the new fingerprint scanner embedded in the home button is a capacitive touch based sensor, like the one on the iPhone 6. All you do is place your finger on the home button to unlock the phone. You can set up a total of 4 fingers, and the sensor is extremely reliable and useful. Every person using this phone should have the fingerprint sensor turned on since it provides good security while being intuitive to use. Camera: The camera is a 16 megapixel sensor with OIS. The Galaxy S6 has the best camera out of all Android phones, and easily competes with the iPhone 6 Plus. Because of the higher resolution, images are extremely detailed. The Optical Imaging Stabilization ensures pictures are clear, while videos are buttery smooth. The OIS also helps at night, as the sensor can pull in more light without creating a blurry image. The result is an amazing camera that can produce vibrant and beautiful pictures during the day, and a camera that can create accurate and bright pictures at night. The camera is also capable of 4K video recording, and slow motion video as well. An important new feature the Galaxy S6 incorporates is the double click on home button to activate. When you double click the home button, it opens the camera in less than 1 second! The ""just shoot"" mentality this camera gives its users is simply amazing and unmatched. For the pro users out there, the camera includes a professional mode that users can use to adjust ISO, white balance, and more settings. The front camera is 5 megapixels, and it is a strong front facing camera. Not much can be said about it, but it produces beautiful selfies and good colors, and is more than adequate for all users. Quick Charging and Wireless Charging: The Galaxy S6 is capable of adaptive quick charging using the charger supplied in the box. This charges the Galaxy S6 extremely fast; you can get about 4 hours of use only with 10 minutes of charging. The phone also supports other Qualcomm Quick Chargers. The Galaxy S6 also supports the",blublue,Samsung_S6,700

I was trying to decide whether to get the new iPhone 6 or the Samsung Galaxy S6. I'm immensely happy that I went with Samsung. I can safely say that I will not be going back to Apple any time soon. The most common complaint I've read and heard is that the battery life is awful. I'm rarely down to 10% with even heavy usage. I was skeptical of the fast charging technology, but it definitely works. Pros: I was worried that the screen would be too big, but it's the perfect size. Amazingly clear screen Good battery life Not much bloatware Amazing camera! It's supposed to set a new standard for phones Rapid charging is nice Wireless charging is a nice feature Very thin The phone doesn't have any cheap looking material Eh... I honestly don't care about the removable battery. My past two phones haven't had it and I have had no battery issues, so I'm not missing it. I was originally horrified at the lack of and SD card, but 32GB is plenty for me. I've added all of my apps, tons of pictures, and 1,000 high quality songs and I still have 10GB left. Cons The back camera sticks out quite a bit. The phone lags a bit I think this is me more getting used to the phone, but when I text I must hit a button because it unfocuses and I have to touch the screen again No waterproofing like the Samsung S5 The material is far better, but I fear that all the glass will just make it easier to break I would 100% recommend this phone.

2 of 3 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 15, 2015",I actually have the S6 edge. I absolutely have this phone. I bought the 64g so I would not have to worry about storage. It by far and away is the best phone I have ever used. The fact that you cannot change out the battery does not bother me. In all the years I have had smart phones I have never had to change a battery. Of course I only keep a phone for about 3 years and then move on due to tech advancements. It was easy to set up and I had very little to do to get all my apps up and running. I rarely if ever take photos with my phone but if I have to this after testing is amazing. Being a photographer I am kind of picky and I may use this one more than in the past. I have been a galaxy fan ever since they came out. There will always be detractors if they are an apple devotee but I stick with Samsung. The Iphone also does not have an sd card and I am grateful not to be tied to the their app store. I think all the hype about loss of the card slot and removable battery is ridiculous since I know most are out to get the latest and the best. I have a tablet to do major work on...my phone is for convenience. You cannot expect a phone to take the place of your tablet or laptop. They never will. I never download every app available and I think this is the problem with most complaints. Load what you use ...even a computer gets slow if you have too many apps loaded and open. I insure this phone on my homeowners policy under scheduled property. If anything happens to it it will get replaced and so I am not worried just enjoying it.,Amazon Customer,Samsung_S6,704

Don't get me wrong, functionally I prefer my personal cell, the Nexus 6, but when I got the S6 as my office device I was a happy man. You don't see the lags you did with the S5, it has a smoother experience and compliments Android L perfectly. Battery life isn't great; I MUCH prefer the Nexus 6 for battery life and would love a removable battery for hot swapping. In its favor, the display on the S6 is amazing (which ironically may be the reason the battery doesn't last) and it just feels the right size. I love my Nexus, but it's a big one, whereas the S6 just seems better fitted. The hardware is great, Samsung's TouchWiz isn't that intrusive, and overall you'll be thrilled with this device.

,5,,"on September 13, 2015","I upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy S4. These are the things I like better about the S6: Brighter display. Two part volume button makes it easier to adjust the volume. Being able to close apps by touching the icon to the left of the home button instead of having to hold down the home button. Using the flashlight on the quick settings panel rather than needing a separate app. Being able to scroll down the settings panel rather than having to choose from the different types of settings in advance. Even though the screen is slightly bigger the overall size of the phone feels smaller.. I use an Otter Box Defender Series case, as I did with the S4, and it definitely is less bulky than before. I have an armband for the phone. I can put the entire case in the armband with the S6 whereas with the S4 I needed to remove the outer layer of the case. The included fast charger is definitely faster than the S4 charger.",Marilyn T. Schwartz,Samsung_S6,712

MUSIC GROUPIES: I nearly had panic attack when I realized I was leaving apple perfect music setup. BUT just pay Google play their 10 a month same as apple music. Google music app saves 50000 songs free takes several hours and excellent WiFi just like apples iMatch. THEN buy these apps MUSIC MATE 3.99 and POWER AMP 4.99. Problem solved. Google music app saves all of your music>Music Mate then pulls the media down from the cloud> Power Amp is the best media app on the google market. Music is all that I cared about. But it worked out. Recently left apple because of the general lack of options for what you pay for. The only thing you will miss about apple is apple care. This phone does every thing else.

Only problem I have noticed is the blue-tooth is poor on my phone, hooks up OK to the GM units in vehicles but blue-tooth headsets sound bad and disconnect even if 3 or 4 feet away. I tried a Dylan new version and Vorager Pro HD and returned them both only to find VXI BT350 and VXI Reveal to work satisfactory. The blue-tooth is the only issue that I have found so far. Battery life is sufficient and we love the wireless charging. Phones do get a bit warm but nothing that I think is worrisome, very little lag time with these..

5 of 8 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 10, 2015","For readers, my opinions on this device (ATT 32Gb version) is based off the experiences I had with this device for the passed few hours as today is launch day (April 10, 2015). I will continue to update this review in the future. This review should be the similar to Galaxy S6 on other carriers such as Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile. Pros: - No more plastics and cheap material. Samsung is finally giving us the hardware that we've long desired. By far, the best designed Galaxy phone to date imo - 5.1 in, QHD Super AMOLED screen. The screen is absolutely gorgeous that it hurts my eyes a bit. I'm still adjusting to it. - 16MP Camera with Smart OIS and 5MP front camera. Very well specs, but even better in performance. In short, the best camera on any android phones. I cannot believe that the picture came out so well in low light environment. You have to try it yourself to believe how great these low light pictures come out. - Gorilla Glass 4 panels for front and back (reminds me of the iPhone 4 and Nexus 4). Gorilla Glass are known to be tough and scratch resistance. - Comes in various colors: White, black, gold, green, blue (US only get the white, black, and gold unfortunately) - Comes in 32, 64, or 128GB of built-in memory. (For the 32gb - 3.7gb is for system partition, 25.2 for data/apps/pictures) - Less of the TouchWiz’s gimmicky features like the eye scroll, eye away from the screen pause. So we will not be experiencing the same slowdown or low storage as we did with earlier versions. If the GS4/5 were all about the features, this phone is all about the design. I do like the camera app and how they add a ""close all"" into the recent screen. - Rapid charging (need to use this more to confirm their claim of 4hrs of battery in 10 minute charge - UPDATED 5/1/15 i am getting about 1 to 1 1/2 hrs of use after the 10 minute charge, I'm guessing the 4hr claim is idle??) - Wireless charging - So if you have extra money that you want to drop for a wireless charging dock, you will be able to use it with this phone. Cons (Not necessarily apply to everyone): - No removable back panel. - No removable battery. I’m a battery hog, so I’m always draining my battery by 3-4pm. Not being able to just swap out my battery will be a pain, but let’s wait to see if the battery swap will be needed in a month when I fully test this device. - Lower battery capacity - 2550mAh compared to the 2600mAh in GS4 and 2800mAh in GS5. With the new processor, battery usage should be more efficient so it should not be a big deal, but end-users would rather the capacity to increase than decrease (Will update if this make through a day of normal usage, UPDATED 5/1/15 - I'm getting average about 8-9 hrs of normal usage, not ideal but I'll manage) - No waterproofing like the GS5, but I never used a smartphone that was waterproofed before, so not a big issue ""to me"" - No ability to swap out memory card – Might bother some Galaxy fans, but with the higher memory options, I do not think this is a huge problem. - Still no on-screen navigation button – Might only be a problem for ""pure"" Android fan. - Rear Camera and Flash sticks out a bit and not flush with the back panel. - Front and back glass is a potential problem as we all experiences with iPhone 4 and Nexus 4. Glass will break if you drop your phone at the right angle regardless how much stronger it is, so ""case up"". - The 1 speaker at the bottom is louder, however when you turn it on max, you will get some distortions in the audio quality. - There are some apps on there that I prefer downloading myself rather than them pushing it on me. There are some Social apps or Microsoft apps included such as OneDrive, facebook, etc. I personally use these apps, but there are people who don't. - I have been experiencing some weird stutters/lags while messing around the phone. This might because I'm loading a bunch of apps into it right now. I will need a few more days to look into this. Overall, this feels like a this is a solid de",FrozenCloud,Samsung_S6,736

1 of 2 people found the following review helpful,4,,"on June 26, 2015","First let me say I love this phone. I have to admit though, for the first month or so... I wondered what I'd gotten myself into, as I wound up totally obsessed with how much battery life was left, because it went so fast. I purchased an ""Anker 2nd Gen Astro E5 16000mAh Portable Charger External Battery Power Bank with PowerIQ Technology 2-Port 3A "" to help, so I could at least leave home and not worry quite as much that I'd wind up with a dead phone running errands. Even so, I still continued to find my focus on my dwindling battery life. I am not one of those people who previously had a Samsung Galaxy anything, so it was not due to being disappointed with the non-removable battery like some previous customers have been. I previously had several iPhone versions before making the switch this spring and never had an issue with battery life. I finally solved the problem by setting my phone to the first Power Saving Mode. I'm disappointed it was necessary to do so, and I hope in two years when I may be ready to pick up a new phone again that Samsung will have FIXED this flaw in their phone, so you can use it for at least a day or so before needing to tether it to something. For now, using the Power Saving Mode has made it last a day or so and I'm no longer frantically keeping track of the battery power (in large part because I do have that back up Anker 'brick' I can use if it runs low or out) It does take amazing pictures, the screen clarity is also amazing and I love it. It's slim and light enough that with the Spigen Air Cushion crystal clear case it still fits in my pocket easily. I've read a lot of complaints about the still existent bloatware and that some things that don't come with the phone from Samsun and that you elect to download also can't be gotten rid of once downloaded, which is a detractor as well. I've been afraid to add anything by Samsung for fear I wouldn't be able to delete it, only 'disable' it. I have a 64 g, but had intended to get 128g but none were available in gold, so I settled for the 64. I also have a complaint about these companies like Samsung and Apple who have all this hype over new products coming out and lead you to believe you'll be able to get what they advertise. This is not the case. I waited till the end of April and was told the sapphire case which is what I fell in love with would not be available in the US, though it's available in many other places. And that perhaps it might be available around the HOLIDAYS. Right... so I was supposed to either wait till the end of the year or I guess they think I'll buy another one then. Not likely. Just a very dissatisfied Samsung Sales Tactics customer now. That pretty much felt like a big feck you to me, from the Samsung Corp. So... sure I'd recommend this phone, it's very nice. But, I may not buy another... will have to see how Samsung does in the future. I don't enjoy being made to feel the fool.",M. Webber,Samsung_S6,746
1 of 2 people found the following review helpful,3,,"on June 24, 2015","I was due for a phone but frankly hadn't found a form factor that I liked as well as my old S3. This phone has a lot going for it. The camera seems to take very good pictures even in mediocre light, the screen is beautiful, and it's the fastest phone I've tested with the processor intensive apps we write. That's the good. The bad unfortunately is outweighing the good however. I had my S3 without a case for three years without a scratch on the screen. Three days after I get the S6 and before my case arrived a small plastic yogurt cup rolled over the screen and scratched it bad as the both sat on my car seat. If I hadn't seen it I wouldn't have believed it was so soft and fragile. My case shows up today but I don't think this screen is going to look good in six months and I'm pretty careful with stuff. Second is the non-replaceable battery. I thought it was idiocy for Apple to put a built in battery in the Iphones and Samsung went and did the same thing. Absolutely braindead because batteries deteriorate so fast in my experience and just so they could shave a mm or two on thickness. Since a human being has to actually hold this thing I don't get it. Bragging rights doesn't make the ergonomics good. Last issue isn't a dealbreaker but a general observation. This fascination with metal on phones representing quality is idiotic. It's heavier, gets hotter or colder to the touch, and just doesn't feel as good. Following Apple stupidly into their design is not a sign of a leader and the Apple fans are always going to have some reason to justify their reasoning. You aren't going to change their minds as they will make something else up. This could have been a great phone but I don't think it will last long at this point.",Mike C,Samsung_S6,747
1 of 2 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on May 8, 2015","I spent a lot of time going back and forth between the HTC One M9 and the Samsung Galaxy S6 prior to settling on this phone. My previous phone was the HTC One M7, which I absolutely loved. My wife has a Samsung Galaxy S4. Between the M7 and the S4, I thought the clear winner was the M7 due to its superior UI, audio quality, display, look and feel. Two years later, I am surprised to say that the Galaxy S6 is the clear winner. The S6 has improved upon the S4 in nearly every area. A lot of criticism has been heaped on the S6 for abandoning the microSD card, removable battery and water resistant design. While, those are helpful features for many people, personally I don't really have any need for these features and probably wouldn't have taken advantage of them, as my wife has not with her S4. For me, the major draws of the S6 were the new display, the build quality and the camera. The display is, to me, the most significant improvement over the S4. I may be picky, but I really can't stand the over-saturated colors on the S4. In addition to upping the resolution to quad HD on the S6, the display has been improved to reproduce colors vibrantly but accurately, with terrific contrast and okay performance in the sunlight. The camera is similarly close to perfection (for a phone), and finally has convinced me to stop bringing a digital camera with me on vacation. The new aluminum frame that surrounds the S6 may seem like a minor tweak to the S4, but it really makes the phone feel much more high end. The phone has a nice weigh to it now and just feels incredibly solid and looks great. Some of the other features that make the S6 stand out for me are the fingerprint reader, processor, UI and battery life. The fingerprint reader works well, but not perfectly and it is far better than having a password, which I wouldn't have bothered with otherwise. The processor is incredibly capable and does not get that hot even under heavy load. The UI is much better than that of the S4, more intuitive and more streamlined. Although it didn't work well, presumably because I had my phone in airplane mode the whole time, I was pleasantly surprised to come back from vacation to find a chronicle of my trip complete with the pictures I had taken. Battery life is great...almost infinite compared to my aged HTC One. It always lasts me a full day and even if it didn't, the adaptive charging is shockingly fast. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the S6. It is a huge step up from the One M7 or Galaxy S4. I imagine the HTC One M9 would also have kept me happy, just slightly less so. I feel that the HTC One M9 does have some strengths that may make it a better choice for a select audience, but the S6 seems like the winning choice for most users.",JFin,Samsung_S6,748

I will continue to update this review in the future. This review should be the similar to Galaxy S6 on other carriers such as Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile. Pros: - No more plastics and cheap material. Samsung is finally giving us the hardware that we've long desired. By far, the best designed Galaxy phone to date imo - 5.1 in, QHD Super AMOLED screen. The screen is absolutely gorgeous that it hurts my eyes a bit. I'm still adjusting to it. - 16MP Camera with Smart OIS and 5MP front camera. Very well specs, but even better in performance. In short, the best camera on any android phones. I cannot believe that the picture came out so well in low light environment. You have to try it yourself to believe how great these low light pictures come out. - Gorilla Glass 4 panels for front and back (reminds me of the iPhone 4 and Nexus 4). Gorilla Glass are known to be tough and scratch resistance. - Comes in various colors: White, black, gold, green, blue (US only get the white, black, and gold unfortunately) - Comes in 32, 64, or 128GB of built-in memory. (For the 32gb - 3.7gb is for system partition, 25.2 for data/apps/pictures) - Less of the TouchWiz’s gimmicky features like the eye scroll, eye away from the screen pause. So we will not be experiencing the same slowdown or low storage as we did with earlier versions. If the GS4/5 were all about the features, this phone is all about the design. I do like the camera app and how they add a ""close all"" into the recent screen. - Rapid charging (need to use this more to confirm their claim of 4hrs of battery in 10 minute charge - UPDATED 5/1/15 i am getting about 1 to 1 1/2 hrs of use after the 10 minute charge, I'm guessing the 4hr claim is idle??) - Wireless charging - So if you have extra money that you want to drop for a wireless charging dock, you will be able to use it with this phone. Cons (Not necessarily apply to everyone): - No removable back panel. - No removable battery. I’m a battery hog, so I’m always draining my battery by 3-4pm. Not being able to just swap out my battery will be a pain, but let’s wait to see if the battery swap will be needed in a month when I fully test this device. - Lower battery capacity - 2550mAh compared to the 2600mAh in GS4 and 2800mAh in GS5. With the new processor, battery usage should be more efficient so it should not be a big deal, but end-users would rather the capacity to increase than decrease (Will update if this make through a day of normal usage, UPDATED 5/1/15 - I'm getting average about 8-9 hrs of normal usage, not ideal but I'll manage) - No waterproofing like the GS5, but I never used a smartphone that was waterproofed before, so not a big issue ""to me"" - No ability to swap out memory card – Might bother some Galaxy fans, but with the higher memory options, I do not think this is a huge problem. - Still no on-screen navigation button – Might only be a problem for ""pure"" Android fan. - Rear Camera and Flash sticks out a bit and not flush with the back panel. - Front and back glass is a potential problem as we all experiences with iPhone 4 and Nexus 4. Glass will break if you drop your phone at the right angle regardless how much stronger it is, so ""case up"". - The 1 speaker at the bottom is louder, however when you turn it on max, you will get some distortions in the audio quality. - There are some apps on there that I prefer downloading myself rather than them pushing it on me. There are some Social apps or Microsoft apps included such as OneDrive, facebook, etc. I personally use these apps, but there are people who don't. - I have been experiencing some weird stutters/lags while messing around the phone. This might because I'm loading a bunch of apps into it right now. I will need a few more days to look into this. Overall, this feels like a this is a solid de",FrozenCloud,Samsung_S6,749

1 of 2 people found the following review helpful,2,,"on April 24, 2015","This was the first time I decided to make the big jump into the android world with my wife who was skeptical. I did a lot of research and knew the negatives of this model compared to the last model which was no micro sd card and it's not waterproof. With that in mind I really wanted to give it a shot since it had 32gb of storage which was what most people used for storage when purchasing micro sd cards for previous Galaxy models that took them. Also I wanted out of using iTunes. Well my experience lasted less then a few days before we had it sent back. The man culprit was the horrendous battery life. No matter what you do it lasts less then 8 hours on minimal usage. Good luck if you are a gamer that likes COC or playing a little Candy Crush. Also I had to do 3 ID scans to make it start recognizing my thumbprint without having constant fails when trying to login to the home screen. The only positive experience was the camera. It does take amazing pictures, but the poor battery life was enough to make me and my wife swap it out before our trial date was over.",Christopher Ringen,Samsung_S6,754

I upgraded from the S4, which scrolled through the screens in a circular fashion. Oddly enough the S6, does not scroll through circular. For instance, if you have three sceens you go 1,2,3 and then you have to go back 3,2,1 in order to get back to the first screen. Whereas the S4 you could go 1,2,3,1,2,3. That's the only thing I've found disappointing so far, so pretty good overall! The speed is always top notch when you first get the phone.

It also comes with A LOT more pre-downloaded apps ! And the apps that are downloaded are way easier to delete than from previous galaxies. All you do is drag and uninstall ! When hitting the home button twice instead of activating the S voice it starts the camera. There have been many times I missed a picture trying to get to the camera. The one thing I do not like is you can't open the back to the battery and there is no external memory. I loved that about my S3 !,that one guy says,Samsung_S6,779

2 of 4 people found the following review helpful,4,,"on April 16, 2015","This is my first Samsung cell phone. I'm a sucker for specs first, aesthetics second but it has to function well with good reception. This phone packs all of those things. I've stayed away from Samsung mostly because they were unattractive and I have read many reviews that complained of antenna issues, weak reception. The galaxy s6 seems to have good reception so far. The beautiful glass over a brushed sapphire blue metallic backing is beautiful and the glass feels as if there is a coating that helps your finger glide over the screen yet it isn't particularly slippery in hand. I'm not a huge fan of square cameras on phones, purely on aesthetic principle. It also bulges out, protruding maybe 1/8"" or 3 mm. Which I disliked at first until I used it. It takes such great photos! This is am excellent camera. Once you throw a case on the phone, which you will be hard pressed to do because of how nice this phone looks, the bulge can be an asset. No chance of a case causing glare that happens with flush mounted lenses in a case. The speaker, charging port and headphone jack are on the bottom bezel. Leaving the top clean and uncluttered. The top has a small black dot which is the ir blaster. The left sports volume buttons. I really prefer this two button set up over a rocker, even if the rocker is sleeker. The two button configuration makes for positive feed back knowing which way the volume will go. The right side has a power key. Simple with good tactile feedback. Along the base, you have a home button, oblong with a polished silver bezel. This houses a fingerprint scanner. This is an option I never saw the use for until I used it. This is the most convenient way to secure your phone ever. I've never used security on my previous phone, even disabling the swipe to unlock feature. It's just an unnecessary hassle. This phone, it's locked but all you need to do is press the home screen. It's fast enough that it's not a hassle at all. To the left is the multi task button, to the right the back button. I like that the keys are on the bezels and not taking up screen space. They light up brightly but they time out quickly and become distracting, I disabled the light. Since they're is no printed icons, it maintains the clean look. The phone is surprisingly light weight but carries enough heft that it doesn't feel cheap. The screen is gorgeous. The definition is really over kill but I'm not complaining. It's crisp, bright and colorful. Battery life has been fine for me but I haven't really put it to the test. Have not spent a full day away from a charger since I bought it. I get the impression it will be similar to my HTC one (m7) which was great for my needs. No external memory is always a bummer. I lived with it for two years with my m7 and found it was a non issue. It is convenient to have but not a necessity. No removable battery, again, lived without this feature on my m7 for two years and it was also a non issue. I used to carry around two spares with my HTC reZound which was a hassle. If this phone can make 12 hours with my typical use, I'll be thrilled, if not, a juice pack will be in my future. Touch wiz. I'm trying to give it a chance but I really don't like it. That's easy to fix with other launchers but I like the functionality of native launcher widgets. I have been on sense and living it for four years. I really like that ui. So it's obviously a personal precedence. The settings are a bit different to navigate too. Not fond of the way touch wiz does the settings but again, that's subjective. This phone also can take your pulse, count your steps and check your blood oxygen levels. Kind of odd but it's still a neat feature. This phone used a quick charge protocol. Very cool, you get a quick charge for like the first 30-40% of battery. In ten or fifteen minutes. From dead, it is supposed to charge in just over an hour. It supports wireless charging as well which is very convenient. Over all, this is a great phone. Not so sure I would",nynvolt,Samsung_S6,797

It's not as awesome as ""they"" make it out to be, but in reality, it's really not that big of a deal for me. This phone is not only gorgeous and feels great in your hands (did order a clear case for it, though. Silppery!), it's wicked fast. No stalls, no lags, applications and websites come up instantly. And the fingerprint scanner is off the charts good, so good you don't even notice you're using it to open your phone. I like how it's not so loaded down with unremovable bloatware (thanks, Samsung!).

I got the phone in Kuala Lumpur and unfortunately I broke my screen here in the US. As a consumer I would like to get it replaced with the service provider so that I have a satisfaction, but guess what I got to hear from the customer service, I was told to get it repaired by the Malaysian Samsung service center.

1 of 3 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on May 25, 2015","I recently purchased this from a verizon retail store in town. For the past 2 years I've had the HTC m7. It was a fantastic phone. Then the top speaker blew so I wanted something new. I was torn between this and the HTC M9. I researched both phones and features extensively and came to the conclusion that I'd get the s6. And it was a good choice as this is an amazing phone. The screen is beautiful. The imaging for the camera is amazing. The build quality is very good and battery life is just as good. I really do like the fingerprint unlock feature. The ui took a bit to get used to coming from sense but I like it. Double taping the home button brings up the camera lightning fast and I really like that. The only thing that made me debate most between the two is the front booming speakers on the M9 and there is an SD slot. Where the main speaker on the s6 is at the bottom, and there is no SD slot. However I use headphones mostly or connect it to my car radio. I bought the 32gb and I feel that it will be enough since I transfer media to my laptop. This phone with the Otterbox defender case is what you want. If you value your phones like I do and don't want them scratched. Get the case and keep your phone looking mint. UPDATE July 14 2015** It's been a few months since I've owned the phone. Bought a charging pad which works awesome. The only issue I've had of the phone now is that it shut off last night without warning. I was playing my xbox as it was charging. I go to unlock the phone and nothing. No red light indicating a charge. Wouldn't power on. A quick Google search led me to others who have had This issue. And the fix is to hold down all 4 physical buttons which brings up a screen. However I held the buttons in too long and factory reset my phone. So now all my Pictures and data was erased. Granted all my Google apps were restored but it was still a huge inconvenience. Still unclear as to what caused the phone to shut off like that. Hopefully it doesn't continue doing that. The battery life is still pretty good. The ultra power saving mode during work keeps me at 80% after a 12 hr shift. That's with Web surfing, Facebook, gmail, clash of clans, texting and calling during my breaks and lunches. Besides, if you want more battery life they now sell battery cases for the phone. Still a 5 star rating hands down.",Kipp,Samsung_S6,825

I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. Samsung Galaxy S6 tries to be a revolutionary, but it is evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. So do check local specs. I played around with both S6 and S6 Edge for few days and my opinions are based on this. There are tons of reviews going into lot of details, so I am focused on few other aspects like what’s out there and how to compare specs. First Big Changes: No microSD or removable battery. I know many of you loyal Samsung fans says BUMMER! I was a die hard fan of Samsung till S4, then I went to LG G2/G3. I think this is the best bet for S6 to pull it off after a dismal year for Samsung last year. I was very curious to try out S6 and HTC One M9 as they are most talked about now. Many manufacturers are going away from microSD card slots and this is absolutely a must and is a key differentiator from iPhone. I am really sad Samsung decided to drop microSD card slot as well as no removable battery. Why?! Screen is a beauty on S6 – Just Gorgeous. Just go to a retail store and feel it! The Edge feature is still gimmicky. Unlike Note Edge, this has both sides so less dorky but still I am not sold yet. Unless you have loads of money, I will shy away from it for one more year and get it next year when they polish it up. It is certainly fancy and nice to show off, but I would rather buy an Android wear watch like Motorola 360 or Samsung Gear or LG R series. I like Motorola 360 but waiting for version 2 to appear. I like Round watches. IF YOU HAVE LAST YEAR model of any phone, PLEASE DON’T upgrade. Phones are becoming so standard and power packed it makes no sense to upgrade and waste money every year. I buy and sell so many phones as it is like a hobby for me, but I stick to one phone as primary for couple of years now. My main requirements are a 128 GB microSD, good screen, battery life and performance. I am trying hard to see if I can live without one. S6 and S6 Edge comes in a 128 GB variant and I will wait for prices to stabilize on this model. In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size, weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don’t advertise or mention SAR prominently. phone parameters: {size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR rating} Samsung Galaxy S6: 5.65 x 2.78 x 0.27 in, 138 gm, 1440 x 2560 pixels, 5.1 in, 577 ppi, 3 GB RAM, NO MICROSD SLOT (bummer), Internal Storage upto 128 GB, Exynos 7420 Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2.1 GHz Cortex-A57, Gorilla Glass 4, 16 MP/5MP camera, SAR 1.15 W/kg (head), 1.16 W/kg (body) NANO SIM Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge: Slightly lower dimensions, 0.01 in thicker, 6 gm less weight, Same resolution, Curved Screen, HTC One M9: 5.69 x 2.74 x 0.38 in, 157 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 3 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 20.7 MP (rear), 4 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 810, Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2 GHz Cortex-A57 Samsung Galaxy S5: 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 in, 145 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.1 in, 432 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, MSM8974-AC Processor: Quad core, 2500 MHz, Krait 400, 0.63 W/kg (head), 0.82 W/kg (body) HTC One M8: 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 in, 160 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 4 MP (rear), 5 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, Quad core, 2300 MHz, Krait 400, 0.94 W/kg (head), 0.83 W/kg (body) LG G3: 5.76 x 2.94 x 0.35 in, 149 gm, 2560 x 1440 pixels, 5.5 in, 538 pp",rpv,Samsung_S6,834

I've never really used cases on phones before but I will buy one for this phone. It gets 3 stars for a few reasons. The bloatware.... Just starting it up I was prompted over and over again for this samsung app and that. Really manufacturers need to calm down on their own skins and programs. I know Android had an ugly history but now it looks great. Where Android is the ugly ducking that grew into a swan. Touchwiz has seen better days. The colors scheme is such a far cry from where stock Android is going. The themes not any better. In fact I don't know who has worse themes. Touchwiz or Swiftkey. Do yourself a favor and download Nova launcher if you're used to a stock android look. Though you still can't get rid of the horrible looking notification pull down. Seriously who thought seafoam was a good idea. The keyboard is horrible. It is the worst keyboard imaginable. Trying to get through all of these Samsung screens an activating my phone was a huge pain with this keyboard. I wanted to chuck my new phone across the room. I had to get into the play store stop it from updating and download the Google Keyboard just so I could finish activating it. Luckily I was at home with wifi. Yes I am taking a star away even though I can download a new keyboard. Had they left the google keyboard in the phone it would've been fine, but no we gotta take the keyboard away to make room for some apps and games I will never ever use. Samsung you make great phones but horrible software. Leave that to Google and stop skinning their OS and coming up with your own keyboard. This is a 5 star phone if you leave it alone after the hardware. I'll comeback and update this after a few months. 1 Week update I am returning the phone. It is an upgrade over my Nexus 5 in 3 ways. 1. It's prettier, but you need a case so who cares 2. Its camera is amazing 3. The screen has a higher resolution than my TV Those 3 things cannot save this phone though. The battery....Haha hope you're always near a charger. I had to charge it 3 times in one day. All I use my phones for is GPS phone calls web browsing and music. I don't play games on my phone. I really do nothing processor intensive. What finally made me return this was the heat. While browsing the web it would heat up. While sitting on the bed untouched for over 3 hours it would heat up. Maybe I got a defective unit, but if reading the comments about the battery life are any indication I am not in the minority.",Mattressburn,Samsung_S6,841

It feels more solid in the hand than both the S4 and S5, which I had previously, and also competitors such as the LG G3 and HTC M9. It actually feel remarkably similar to the iPhone 6, which may be a positive or negative depending on your viewpoint. For me, the deciding factor is whether or not you prefer the more customizable Android or the smoother functioning iOS. I ended up choosing the S6 because I got a good trade-in deal on my S5, but I can't say I'm disappointed with the decision. PROS -beautiful-looking piece of tech -sharp, bright, vivid display -solid camera Cons -If there's one minor complaint about this phone, it's that it doesn't seem as durable as the S4, S5. I didn't use a case with either, dropped them many times, and never had a problem. With it's glass back, the S6 seems more fragile, though that is also what makes it more beautiful to look at and hold.",BMT,Samsung_S6,851

Time to upgrade and to get our three children their first mobile phones. Looked into the S6 but it was several steps back from the S3 that I already owned. Picked up 3 of the S4's for our kids and 2 of the S5's for us instead. I was looking for IMPROVEMENTS over my S3 that the S4 & S5 provided while the S6, very surprisingly, was not an improvement on the S5 where it mostly mattered to us. I have never had a smart phone without external storage and replaceable batteries and hopefully some company will still be offering these options when it is time for us to upgrade our phones again. Might as well just buy an IPhone if this is the future trend of android phones.",Robert M. Kenny,Samsung_S6,869

I had the phone less than a couple of weeks, I dropped it and the screen broke. I've had multiple phones and I own all kinds of portable electronics but I've never had anything fail after a two foot drop on the floor. If you are buying this as a mobile phone, maybe carrying it in your pocket, using it as part of your daily routine etc. then I don't think it's for you.

Now my contract is up with the S4, but I need to break from this line. Two reasons for the break: 1) NO REMOVABLE BATTERY 2) NO EXPANDABLE micro SD slot I've always been an apologist for Samsung Galaxy S* battery life. My alibi was always, ""sure it sucks, but I can carry a replacement. . .and when the original degrades, I throw it out and can keep the phone"" - no longer - and the reviews prove that the S6 non-removable battery isn't good enough, without a backup, at least the IPhone battery lasts when it's new. No option for an external micro SD is just stupid, especially if you're like me and don't like the cloud. You can keep your beautiful thin non-functional phone, Samsung.

2 of 9 people found the following review helpful,1,,"on May 4, 2015","I had an S6 using Sprint Service purchased from Best Buy. It will not stay on a call. It dropped every I made using it. If someone called me the phone would go straight to voice mail. Apps would not open giving error messages all the time or force close. The battery would last little more than 4 hours needing to be charged constantly. You can not talk on the S6 and make use of data i.e. internet at the same time, a step backwards in technology from the S4 it was replacing. The phone has way to many bugs on the Sprint network to be of any use, fist and foremost a phone must perform as a phone and the Sprint Samsung Galaxy S6 was not doing so. When I called Sprint the rep told me to return the phone while i was still within the 14 day return period, they were aware of problems and had no fix date in sight. As pretty as it was, as nice as it felt the phone was useless on the Sprint network for me. Did I like anything about the phone, sure; Lollypop was fast and smooth, no stutter or lag at all like with the S4. The built in wireless charging is a nice touch but none of that matters as the phone is so buggy it cant be used. I never got to fully play with the new camera so I cant type on that but if your a Sprint customer don't take my word for it, goto the Sprint website and look at their community site and ALL the complaints just like mine on the S6 dropping calls, apps not working correctly, battery drains and terrible connectivity and slow speeds. I don't know if its Sprint, lollypop or both but steer away from the phone for a while to see if Samsung or Sprint can get it working correctly.",joe01880,Samsung_S6,879

35 of 39 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 8, 2015","Wow, what a difference a year makes. While last year's S5 took many steps in the right direction(being somewhat waterproof with better material and craftsmanship), it still wasn't there to make it a mouth-watering phone yet, like what HTC did when they first introduced their One M7, or whenever Apple introduces a new iPhone size. This year, Samsung has finally learned from both of their competitors, and made a phone that has all the good qualities of both, plus some of their own. Finally, this is the Galaxy S that you've always wanted and been dreaming of. * LOOKS/FORM-FACTOR/MATERIALS: The very first thing you notice when you handle the phone, is its new design and form factor - finally Samsung has completed their transformation of getting rid of all that ugly plastic parts. Now it is just all glass and metal, and now it is truly beautiful. The metal fully wraps around the edges ofthe phone. The back is beautiful, the sides are beautiful - heck, even the buttons are beautiful. It feels great in the hand, and oozes style and sophistication. * SCREEN: The very next thing you notice, of course, is the screen. I am continually pleasantly surprised at the evolution of Samsung's AMOLED technology - it has now became the best screen in the industry, hands down. I used to defend the LCD technology of the HTC M7, and at that point it was in fact overall superior to the Samsung S4 because the AMOLED then had issues in the sun, and color reproduction(it was too saturated and not natural). But now, they have fixed those issues, and the S6's screen is just quite simply the best. If you don't believe it, just compare an LG/Samsung OLED TV to any LED TVs today. I still think 5.1 inches for a screen of a PHONE is still too big, but overall, for what smartphones represent nowadays, it is acceptable - we have conditioned ourselves to accept the bigger sizes of smartphones(I remember when I first held a 4.2"" smartphone when it first came out - the HTC HD2 - and thought, ""what the h3ll is this monstrosity??""). * It doesn't hurt that Samsung boosted up the resolution to 1440 x 2560 pixels, which is approximately 577 ppi in pixel density. Although this is quite overkill right now, it's always nice to have the latest and greatest technology - that's the reason why we buy these overpriced phones in the first place, isn't it? It is also very bright, and sunlit legibility is excellent. Color reproduction is quite accurate, and like the S5, you can choose different color modes to suit your liking. *BATTERY LIFE: An important aspect to discuss is the battery life, now more than ever because there is no removable back cover to make replacing the battery easily like before, not to mention there is no microSD slot for you to add memory space to your phone. Comparatively, the S6 Edge is supposed to last a little less than the S6 regular, which I've read is less than last year's S5. But I'm one of those who are always around a charger, and I always carry external battery packs in my backpack when I travel, so that's never a concern. Seriously, who even buys an extra battery anymore - which you can only use for a single specific phone model - when your external battery can charge ANY and ALL phones and tablets?? This scenario only makes sense if your work is so demanding that you don't have extra time to charge the phone, and need to swap batteries IMMEDIATELY. I don't think that scenario is realistic nowadays when external batteries are so small, light, and cheap. My S6 goes from 100% at 10 am to about 20% at 10 pm with moderate use - so no complaints there. I get home, plug it up, and there are no issues. * What's better this year, is the wireless charging standards are already built into the phone, so you can just buy a charging pad for about $50 and feel even more cool. * USER INTERFACE/SOFTWARE: The Samsung user interface called TouchWiz used to be bloated and sluggish. It would slow down(navigating throughout the phone, switching between apps, and using",Johnny Amazon®,Samsung_S6,900
15 of 15 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on July 4, 2015","Initial Review 1. Build - Hardware: The build quality of S6 is top notch, if not better, then as good as the iphone. The photos in the website or in the samsung portal do not do justice to the actual look and feel of the phone. There are reviews that mention the s6 look similar to iphone 6 and I would agree to that. I moved from an S3 to S6. The S3 after 3 years of use, had become slow, but moving the same apps to S6, the apps worked seemlessly. 2. Screen: The 577 pixels per inches is pixel density results in a screen with crisp displays and super sharp and smooth images. 3. Software: The android build on the S6 has so far run smoothly for past 3 months and so has all the apps I have used so far. 4. Camera: I havent played around with the photo as much as the video. The video on this is just incredible.4K ultra-HD video. The color reproductions are like something out of Downtown Abbey. Yes, the battery life on a single charge is nothing to talk about. I get a whole days use. The upside is that the phone comes with a super charger that charges the phone to 90% within 30 minutes or so. Long time Review 1-Month: We end up finding some new feature every time we use it. i. GPS navigator - We used S6 as a navigator while travelling to New York. Compare the 60's cartoon screen of an Garmin with 577 ppi screen of S6 and you willl understand why you WANT to use S6 as a navigator even if you dont need to. Google maps has an offline mode, as long as you have enough storage on your phone to download the maps of the location. The best part was that during navigation, an incoming call, would just should up as a smally rectangular bar with information about the caller and accept/decline button and at the same time, the navigation would still be displayed. ii. Finger Print unlock. Setting up is a breeze. there was a bit of apprehension whether if it will work. For one, the fingerprint unlock worked every time, the first time and again, there is a backup password (in case finger print doesnt work)",Pepper,Samsung_S6,901

11 of 14 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 9, 2015","The choice to go with Glass and Aluminum makes this phone's appearance and quality appear to be much better than previous models. The button layout is still the same as older Galaxy models but the button presses now have a reassuring click. The frame is still similar to the other styles as it remains curved. The back gorilla glass is not removable and no longer allows for additional storage or easy battery replacements. The camera sticks out quiet a bit and creates a noticeable bulge on the back of the phone. The glass crystal that should protect the camera is not as strong as the sapphire module found on the iPhone line. The S6 is so lightweight and has a slight slippery feel to it. These are some of my first impressions, but I will break it down more in the rest of the review. Display: The 5.1 inch display is a good size for those who don't want a huge phone, but want a nice size screen. It's a quad-HD 2560X1440 resolution which works out to be 577 pixels per square inch. It has a wonderful display with deep blacks and highly vivid colors. You can always change the saturation to tune the color to your preference. It's incredible to watch with it's 2K resolution. The game play on this is awesome as the screen comes to life. It's bright enough to view in outside sunlight, although you get some glare on the screen. The screen is very sensitive to touch, but that's not always a bad thing. Hardware: The processor Exynos 7420 2.1ghz of performance with 3gb ram minimizes lag with lighting fast reactions from one task to the next. Mali graphics processor really enhances game play. The S6 is missing any expansion slots for external micro sd cards. The base storage for this phone is 32gb, with 64gb and 128gb available as a separate model. It's not upgradeable and you've got to decide what storage needs you have before purchase. It does have the best speakers Samsung has ever put out in the past. They are bottom facing speakers and don't give you as much sound as a rear or forward facing speaker would, but it does have a clear loud sound. The S6 has a much better heart rate monitor than other galaxy's, because of the placement of it. The finger print sensor is now a press type not a swipe type. It works much better than previous models. You can wake the phone while pressing and it unlocks the phone quickly when done as one motion. Battery: The battery is smaller than before at 2550mAh. It should be good for all day for most users. However some users may find it needing to be charged during the day. The s6 does support wireless charging. You can set power saving modes at different battery levels to help you get all day on a single charge. Power saving mode will reduce screen brightness, limit CPU performance, reduced frame rate, turn off touch key light, disable vibration and reduce time before the time is turned off after notifications. I really wish they would have improved the battery and given it a bigger battery capacity. This is potentially the biggest disappointment with the phone for me as I am a heavy user. Camera: The 16 megapixel camera on the back is an improvement as well as the 5 megapixel front facing camera. The camera has a Pro mode which adds extra features and effects. The ability to adjust the focus of a shot is great, you can even change it after the fact. It has good low light photo taking ability with both cameras. Video is available is slow mode as well as 4K, but you cannot benefit from HDR as you would in 1080p. HDR auto appears to be to light when you view your photographs. It does create stunning photos in regular lighting conditions. It features motion tracking and auto focus and keeps the image steady with out tapping the screen to refocus. This is the best camera on a Samsung model to date. Software: Touch wiz works flawlessly and the OS seems smooth thanks to the new hardware. Wiz no longer has those annoying sounds, just simple clicks. The setting screen is now decluttered and simpler to use. The lollipo",Justin D Blackburn,Samsung_S6,904

3 of 4 people found the following review helpful,3,,"on July 31, 2015","Product arrived with the seal almost-but-not-quite broken - hanging on by a 1/8"" piece of sticker, actually. So that was a bit off-putting and I probably won't order from the same seller again. The phone has given me a mixed first impression. I like the camera a lot, and smartphone camera comparison reviews were the main reason why I bought it. Good white balance and good detail even in low light, so I can take pictures of my cats doing dumb stuff after dinner. That's clearly the most important benefit of having a smartphone. :) I also like the ""double click home button to open camera"" feature which works even when the phone is locked. Thanks to that, I can pick up my phone and quickly take a picture of my cat doing dumb stuff, without even putting down my tea in my other hand. I like the unlock button location, the thumbprint unlock feature, and the ability to add extra fingerprints so I can unlock with either thumb and from any angle. Unlocking with one hand instead of two is a small but nice thing that I didn't have with my previous phone (HTC One M7). I don't like the battery life. It doesn't even come close to lasting a full day before it needs to be charged again. Straight out of the box it already drains battery a lot faster than my 2-year-old HTC One M7 - even though my HTC One's battery life degraded a lot while I owned it. I'm comparing a phone that has been through 2 years of hell - heat damage from sauna and beach trips, multiple falls, frequent use - to a brand new Galaxy S6 - and my 2-year-old HTC One battery is still better. Worse, it seems to be reporting app battery usage incorrectly. To confirm this, I charged the Galaxy S6 to 100%, set it to airplane mode and left it unplugged and locked with the screen off all night, and woke up with the charge at 86%. That's pretty bad for a phone that wasn't even being used and wasn't connected to anything. Next, I went to the ""Battery"" settings to see which apps had used all that battery. It said the screen had used overwhelmingly more battery than any other app - yet the screen had been off all night and the battery usage chart confirmed there wasn't a sudden drop like I would see if the screen had been on. And in the list of battery percent used by each app, the percents only added up to half of the amount that it had actually used so far. Something fishy is going on with the battery. I thought my phone might be defective but I googled ""galaxy s6 battery life"" and found out that the battery life for this phone is bad in general, and lots of people report unexplainable battery drain. I also found some recommendations for things to turn off to improve battery life. I repeated the same experiment the next night and the battery went to 94%. So overall, I am hopeful that the battery problem is a fixable software thing - and happy with the camera - but not overwhelmingly pleased with this phone.",Jane Smith,Samsung_S6,906

,4,,"on September 8, 2015","I feel I am uniquely qualified to review this phone. I'm what you call OS agnostic. No, I will not be preaching how iOS is superior to Android or visa-versa. But I own a large assortment of devices on both sides. An iPhone 6+ (64GB), iPad Air 2 as well as various Android devices, tablets, phones and HDMI sticks. So lets get down to it. Design - In a word, this phone is sexy, slim and almost a direct copy of the iPhone 6. Which isn't a bad thing. I have smaller hands and it fits my grip perfect. Compared to my 6+, it's a joy to hold and one handed operation is easy - yes, you can reach the entire screen with normal size fingers. You will want a case for this phone, it's thin - really thin. When I didn't have a case, I was constantly worried I would drop it. The back is glass and somewhat slippery although not too bad. (it's not going to slide out of your hand, but it will slide off a slick surface) The camera protrudes out the back and without a case that matches it's depth from the phone, it's exposed to whatever surface you place it on. This is something you should check when you purchase a case, make sure it protects the lens. The sides are aluminum and I worry they'll wear over time, it feels smooth but delicate to the touch. This is not a phone to be used without a case, if you intend to resell at some point. Speed and Screen - Fast! Every app I've thrown at this has screamed without exception. You will find that nothing bogs down on this phone. It's a 2015 flagship phone and it feels like it. The screen is in a word, incredible. I love Samsung's OLED screens and this phone is no exception. Blacks are solid black with no back lighting. In a pitch black room, an icon on the scree is the only element that emits light. Using this as a nightstand clock does not emit light as non-OLED screens do. Samsung has a special extra bright mode for outdoor viewing in direct light. While it works great, it tends to wash colors out more than I'd like. Still, it's a welcome addition. Out of all the phones I've used, this one has the best screen, bar none. Camera - The current king. Like I said in the beginning of this review, I also own an iPhone 6+. However I tend to prefer this for photos for a couple reasons. The camera is two taps away (launch by tapping the home button twice) this is incredibly intuitive and becomes second nature. The photos are always clean and crisp. You will not be disappointed by the camera on this phone. I did have some issues with focusing on macro shots in low lighting that my 6+ could resolve. Other than that, this has been incredible in almost every sense of the word. Sound - The speaker at the bottom of the phone, while mono puts out some very loud (albeit tinny) sound. Don't expect this to win any metals, but it does a good job and is at least on par with my 6+ if not better than it. Battery - Alright, so yes, it sucks. This is the major hurdle Samsung had when they made this phone this thin and light. Battery life is terrible. I carry a rechargeable pack with me, so for me this isn't a huge problem. This could probably be subverted with a battery case, although I prefer to keep my phone looking as Samsung intended. The quick charger is incredible, charging your phone to full in about an hour. Google Cardboard - I've tried it on multiple phones and on this one it's incredible. The screen is fantastic and pixels are all but invisible to the eye. There is drift, but that's present on all devices with generation 1 of cardboard. (Possibly the magnets) Fingerprint Sensor - Alright, this one is hard. I'm trying not to compare this too much with my 6+ because the ecosystems are so drastically different. But when it comes to this, I have to compare. Lots of reviewers have said it's not as accurate as the iPhone's. While this is true, to unlock my S6 it works perfectly almost every time. (Maybe 9/10 times it works on the first attempt) It works identically to my 6+ except that my iPhone seems to work better at angle",ZeroQuest,Samsung_S6,908
,5,,"on August 23, 2015","After upgrading phones every 6 months or so, I find that the Samsung Galaxy S6 is the best smartphone on the market. It's got a great style with its Gorilla Glass 4 front--and back. The thinness and overall look of the phone makes it standout. This phone is even thinner than the Apple iPhone 6! Don't buy this phone on looks alone. With its speedy processor and great camera you are buying a first class phone. I just came from the HTC One M9 which I really liked, but even that great phone's features looks weak when compared to the Galaxy S6. If you look hard enough you probably can find some faults. Yes this phone does not have the great sound that the HTC One M9 delivers, but you will never notice when you check out the Galaxy S6 overall. It would have been nice if this phone would have included an extra memory slot. A replaceable battery is not possible with this phone since it cannot be removed. Your customization options are never endless with this (and most Android phones). Just try to modify Apple's phones by comparison! Since Samsung's sales were starting to look sluggish compared to Apple's, so they dropped the price by about $100. And that was enough of a difference to make me switch to the Galaxy S6. If you are looking for a top-of-the-line smartphone, look no farther than the Samsung Galaxy S6.",Irv Haas,Samsung_S6,909
,5,,"on September 2, 2015","Although doubtful at first that a samsung s6 would be this cheap, I got this for my sister at her request since she didn't trust the cheaper options on ebay. After checking it out, I can guarantee it is not a fake. The performance and build of the phone is solid with a beautiful screen but then again its a samsung with a hefty price tag. I personally own and love my one plus one which is so much cheaper yet just as snappy. Although the samsung has a better screen, somewhat better looking, and better camera, considering that you can get two for the price of one samsung it is worth it. I'm not gonna bother listing stats because you can google those. Anyways enough about my phone now. I got this with one day shipping and it came quickly and yea thats about it. Heads up about the platinum gold though, the glare when under light is pretty bright and it doesn't look as gold as we would like it. Also the back is glass so please put a case on it or else it will be filled with light scratches and fingerprints by the end of the day you get it. The fingerprint sensor is a bit iffy at times and theres a bug where the touchscreen will stop working sometimes but a reboot and a software update will fix that.",Frank C.,Samsung_S6,910
,5,,"on August 27, 2015","The S6 is an amazing phone with great improvements over the already good Samsung S4 Active in terms of speed, camera image quality and functionality. The fingerprint reader functions very well. The charger, while looking very similar to the previous Samsung chargers, is actually a dual voltage charger that does fast charging then drops the voltage (to the same as the previous chargers) and finishes the charge. You can still use previous usb connectors and Samsung chargers, they will just take longer. I would recommend doing a internet search when you get your phone for S6 ""Tips and Tricks"" since there is a lot of fine tuning you can do to make the phone operate just the way you would like. Also for many users, reading some of the ideas will also get you up and running faster than trying to figure all the options out yourself. The phone was shipped quickly by the seller and arrived in perfect shape, original box and packing. The only thing not included was a warranty. The S6 is actually thinner than the S4 Active. You will want to consider getting a case because the phone is so thin and light, and has no rubber or 'grippy' material anywhere that it could easy slip from your hand. UPDATE: I have had the S6 for a week now and it is a fantastic phone. Can't over emphasis the importance of using Tips and Tricks from a browser search to tailor the set up. You will have no issues using this phone with your nano sim card from one of the US cell companies but the phone CAN NOT be registered with Samsung since the product number will not link with their automated system. So bottom line is it is a great phone that you will need to be willing to 'self insure' because it comes with no guarantee and can't even be registered on Samsungs US site.",jtech,Samsung_S6,911
,1,,"on September 22, 2015","The Galaxy itself is an awesome looking phone with possibly the best display out currently. The colors are vibrant and the camera is excellent. The platinum gold is very unique and it seems to change colors depending on lighting - silver or gold. It's very slippery, but the dual glasses makes it feel premium. The performance is smooth as well. The phone itself is 5 stars. The one I received however is a 1 star due to the front glass panel being tilted. And yes, please read the critical reviews about the factory seals being broken or nonexistent. Mine came with no factory seal, just a one sided sticker that contained a barcode and place of origin. And please read their policies, because some of them are ridiculous. If you get this phone from the wrong seller, you will be screwed. I have a suspicion some sellers are actually selling refurbished (or phones that has been fixed) phones as brand new. All I can say from my experience, beware of WWD. Other than that, the phone is awesome, just be cautious.",Neur0n,Samsung_S6,912

Pictures come out better than ever expected. Wasn't sure if the phone was gonna be too large but it's not. The only issue would be if the volume buttons were farther down side of phone in the same location as the power button it would help.

But the lag, crashes, general Samsung software problems have ruined it for me and I sadly am sending it back. I got the G920I unlocked version which seemed to had been from Panama. It worked great only half the time for my heavy usage (which my iPhone handles without issue).",HPAD,Samsung_S6,915

Instead of the Note Edge having one edged screen, the S6 version has 2. That means that the normal screen is all screen, there will be no notification drops; all of them are displayed at the side.* *Just a quick disclaimer: I just got this phone today at BestBuy and Ive been playing with it for a lot of time nonstop. So far the experience is great and nearly perfect. I encountered no stutters, no lag, no glitches, nothing. I downloaded a couple graphically intensive games and it ran all of them very well. And all in all navigating through the Touchwiz UI was surprisingly smooth, something that I wish I could've complimented in the past Samsung phones. Right now the battery is at 31 percent for me.* Oh god this phone is a masterpiece. Let me just start out by saying that I've had the S5 for about 6 months now. I've mostly liked the phone. I liked it's dependable battery life, it's water and dust resistance, it's gorgeous display, etc. But I felt like some things about it were just a deal breaker. The Touchwiz UI was no better than looking in a trash can. It was slow to respond and had these peculiar bleeps and bloop sounds that were rather annoying than adding something convenient. The air gestures were dope to use first but it quickly got useless. The settings were a total mess and it left a sour taste to a myriad of users including me. I'm most defenitely not the person who will hate any phone because it is made out of plastic and love the other because it has metal, but I did like a well built phone. It's not like I would hate a plastic phone but the S5 did have a better design than the S4, but it still wasn't good. It was an improvement but not one that I loved holding instantly when I picked it up unlike HTC phones. All in all, the S5 wasn't for everyone. Then I saw this phone at MWC 2015. I didn't go the the event but I did watch some videos of this phone at the event. I saw that the S6 had better design, it was made out of glass, it had no expandable storage or battery replacement option, the Touchwiz UI was less ""Touchweezy"" and much cleaner and faster, it had much better specs inside, and there was an S6 edge version. I knew that the S6 was a phone that I've wanted from Samsung long time but I had to experience it firsthand to believe it. So I brought this phone Day 1 from Best Buy, and I have to say, this phone is almost everything that I've wished for. Pros: -Very premium to hold. There is actual metal around the edges, not just shiny plastic and the back is made out of glass, just like the Nexus 4. -The display is the best out of any phone in the market at the moment (4/10/15). Samsung upgraded the display from 1080p to 1440p. This makes it sharper and clearer, but you won't notice the difference that much side by side unless you look close. Also, in traditional Samsung fashion, the phone has great colors, excellent contrast ratio, etc. -Touchwiz UI is cleaner and better than ever. The whole UI seems fast and fluid, especially since it's running on Android 5.0 Lollipop. Some of the features like Air Gesture are no longer there in the settings. It looks flatter. -Great performance. Samsung ditched Qualcomm for their processors in their phone now and they decided to put their well known Exynos processor inside this phone. They also put 3 GB of DDR4 Ram now. The result is a beastly phone that does almost anything you throw at it. Graphically intensive games run very well even at high settings and everyday tasking is smooth. Runs like a beast. -Very fast to charge. I had the battery at 21% and charged it for 30 minutes and it instantly went up to 93%. -Camera has less noise on low light pictures and there is OIS now. Cons: -Not IP67, meaning its not dust proof or water resistant. It would've been nice if they still kept that extra protection from the S5 to this phone, but I haven't dropped a phone in the water for nearly a decade, so this isn't a huge problem ",Ryan,Samsung_S6,1035
36 of 39 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 10, 2015","I originally picked up this Galaxy S6 Edge because of the unique look; but, the more I use it, the more I like it! I've been using Samsung Galaxy phones for several years now; but, I was seriously considering moving on to a competitor until I saw the new S6 Edge. Let me say that this phone not only looks great - it backs up the looks with a fantastic phone! [*** Curved Edge ***] The S6 is an awesome phone, but is the curved edge worth the extra cost? Personally, I see 4 advantages to the curved edge: 1) It looks cool! If you're looking for a unique phone, then this is one of the most unique designs on the market. 2) The alarm clock feature is awesome! I've been using my phone as an alarm clock (like most people), but I've also missed being able to glance over to see the time. (I mean, who doesn't want to confirm that they still have 5 more hours of sleep?) If you consider that a docking alarm clock can easily cost $100 - then this phone starts to seem like a better deal. 3) Without a case, this phone is a little awkward to pick up off a table; but, with a case it's actually easier to hold and handle. This is definitely something I wasn't expecting. 4) The phone feels extremely thin with the curved edge! As a result, it fits great in my pocket and is easy to hold. There are some other features that the curved edge offers (like the colored contact notifications) - but I haven't found them to be overly useful. On top of that, it does tend to be more reflective outside since there are 3 angles catching the sun. I'm glad I went with the Edge, but I can see how that could be a pro or a con depending on who is looking at it. >>> [*** Update 4/19/2015 ***] <<< Finding a screen protector for the Edge turned out to be a bit harder than I expected - and I finally got sick of the one that I initially got with the phone and tried some others. Anyway, if you are looking for a good screen protector, I would highly recommend trying the IQ Shield LiQuidSkin protector. It does a great job of protecting the screen without interfering with the curved edge. [*** Wireless Charging ***] Even with my S5, I used a Qi Receiver Card - and I have to admit that wireless charging is extremely convenient. Fortunately, the S6 has wireless charging built in - and I definitely recommend giving it a try if you get this phone! The main things to keep in mind with wireless charging are: 1) Thick cases do negatively impact wireless charging - so I'd recommend a case that isn't overly bulky. (There are lots of protective cases for the S6 edge that aren't bulky: like the Spigen Neo Hybrid case.) 2) Even though wireless charging is extremely convenient, it's definitely slower than wired charging - so it's not great for a quick charge if you're nearing empty. Personally, I keep a wireless charging pad on my desk at work and by my nightstand. I can just drop the S6 on the charger whenever it looks like the phone is going to start running low. The wireless charging on this phone is more sensitive, and works far better, than using a Qi adapter with the S5 phone. [*** Wired Charging ***] Although I prefer wireless charging, the wired charging performance of the S6 Edge is amazing! When you use wired charging devices, be sure to verify that they're compatible with the Quick Charge 2.0 standard. With my Quick Charge Car Charger, I can get from empty to half full in a matter of minutes! [*** Non-Removable Battery ***] This phone does NOT have a removable battery, so battery life is more important than ever. So far, the S6 Edge seems to have pretty comparable battery life to my previous Galaxy S5 - although I have't done any scientific testing. When combined with the convenience of wireless charging, the battery life isn't an issue at all for me. Having said that, the bigger issue is that I can't easily replace the battery if it dies. Last year, both my phone and my wife's required a battery replacement; and, although it's possible with the S6 Edge, it's definitely not as eas",D. Matheny,Samsung_S6,1036
27 of 29 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 10, 2015","The choice to go with Glass and Aluminum makes this phone's appearance and quality appear to be much better than previous models. The button layout is still the same as older Galaxy models but the button presses now have a reassuring click. The frame is still similar to the other styles as it remains curved. The back gorilla glass is not removable and no longer allows for additional storage or easy battery replacements. The camera sticks out quiet a bit and creates a noticeable bulge on the back of the phone. The glass crystal that should protect the camera is not as strong as the sapphire module found on the iPhone line. The S6 is so lightweight and has a slight slippery feel to it. These are some of my first impressions, but I will break it down more in the rest of the review. Display: The 5.1 inch display is a good size for those who don't want a huge phone, but want a nice size screen. It's a quad-HD 2560X1440 resolution which works out to be 577 pixels per square inch. It has a wonderful display with deep blacks and highly vivid colors. You can always change the saturation to tune the color to your preference. It's incredible to watch with it's 2K resolution. The game play on this is awesome as the screen comes to life. It's bright enough to view in outside sunlight, although you get some glare on the screen. The screen is very sensitive to touch, but that's not always a bad thing. Hardware: The processor Exynos 7420 2.1ghz of performance with 3gb ram minimizes lag with lighting fast reactions from one task to the next. Mali graphics processor really enhances game play. The S6 is missing any expansion slots for external micro sd cards. The base storage for this phone is 32gb, with 64gb and 128gb available as a separate model. It's not upgradeable and you've got to decide what storage needs you have before purchase. It does have the best speakers Samsung has ever put out in the past. They are bottom facing speakers and don't give you as much sound as a rear or forward facing speaker would, but it does have a clear loud sound. The S6 has a much better heart rate monitor than other galaxy's, because of the placement of it. The finger print sensor is now a press type not a swipe type. It works much better than previous models. You can wake the phone while pressing and it unlocks the phone quickly when done as one motion. Battery: The battery is smaller than before at 2600mAh. It should be good for all day for most users. However some users may find it needing to be charged during the day. The s6 does support wireless charging. You can set power saving modes at different battery levels to help you get all day on a single charge. Power saving mode will reduce screen brightness, limit CPU performance, reduced frame rate, turn off touch key light, disable vibration and reduce time before the time is turned off after notifications. I really wish they would have improved the battery and given it a bigger battery capacity. This is potentially the biggest disappointment with the phone for me as I am a heavy user. Camera: The 16 megapixel camera on the back is an improvement as well as the 5 megapixel front facing camera. The camera has a Pro mode which adds extra features and effects. The ability to adjust the focus of a shot is great, you can even change it after the fact. It has good low light photo taking ability with both cameras. Video is available is slow mode as well as 4K, but you cannot benefit from HDR as you would in 1080p. HDR auto appears to be to light when you view your photographs. It does create stunning photos in regular lighting conditions. It features motion tracking and auto focus and keeps the image steady with out tapping the screen to refocus. This is the best camera on a Samsung model to date. Software: Touch wiz works flawlessly and the OS seems smooth thanks to the new hardware. Wiz no longer has those annoying sounds, just simple clicks. The setting screen is now decluttered and simpler to use. The lollipo",Justin D Blackburn,Samsung_S6,1037

My camera is permanently inverted (i need to hold it upside down if I want to take a picture), and the orientation does not change when turning the phone sideways (for everything: camera, games, chrome, etc.). I found many other people online who are having the exact same problem and some have even swapped phones several times. I went in to the Verizon store, and they contacted their Samsung rep. The first one said he was unaware of this issue. I showed the Verizon salesperson all the websites detailing other people having the exact same issue, and they ""said"" they contacted a 2nd Samsung rep, who said it was a Software issue and they were working on a patch. The next day I decided to call Samsung support because I didn't fully trust the Verizon folks. The operator said that Samsung was not aware of this issue and he'd escalate the problem the best that he could. I just want to know if this is a hardware or software issue, and nobody can give me an official answer. I only have 5 more days to wait for a software patch before I reach the Verizon return deadline. I'm probably going to end up returning it and move on to a different device, which is a shame because it is such a fantastic-looking phone. My advice to potential buyers, is wait a couple months until they figure this out... or just go with the non-edge version (the issue appears to only be affecting the S6 edge) Update ** 5/7/2015 ** The best answer I received from Verizon was that it is most likely a software glitch and Samsung is working on a patch (no timeframe given). They offered to replace the phone, but it would take 2 weeks because of an s6 edge shortage. Samsung Support said they were looking in to my complaint. I could send them my phone and they'd either fix it or send me a replacement in 10 days. I didn't like either option and decided to exchange it on the last day of my verizon ""return window"" for the regular S6. I've been using the non-edge version for a week and a half now and I love the phone. I won't go in to long comparison because I didn't get much time with a fully functional S6 Edge, but I will say that the regular s6 feels a lot more stable in my hand. Maybe it's just because I just needed more time to get used to the edge, but it felt ""slicker"". You can read about all the regular features in the other reviews, but there were two things that I really like about the phone (both versions) which I did not know before purchasing it. (this is my first samsung, so sorry if these are old features) 1) The home screen's got a cool ""floating icon"" effect when you tilt the phone --> not useful for anything, but very aesthetically pleasing. 2) The phone allows you to choose up to 30 photos for your lockscreen which will cycle throughout the day. This may not be a gamechanger, but I absolutely love seeing different photos of my 5 month old throughout the day",Jim S.,Samsung_S6,1038

While last year's S5 took many steps in the right direction(being somewhat waterproof with better material and craftsmanship), it still wasn't there to make it a mouth-watering phone yet, like what HTC did when they first introduced their One M7, or whenever Apple introduces a new iPhone size. This year, Samsung has finally learned from both of their competitors, and made a phone that has all the good qualities of both, plus some of their own. Finally, this is the Galaxy S that you've always wanted and been dreaming of. * LOOKS/FORM-FACTOR/MATERIALS: The very first thing you notice when you handle the phone, is its new design and form factor - finally Samsung has completed their transformation of getting rid of all that ugly plastic parts. Now it is just all glass and metal, and now it is truly beautiful. The metal fully wraps around the edges ofthe phone. The back is beautiful, the sides are beautiful - heck, even the buttons are beautiful. It feels great in the hand, and oozes style and sophistication. The S6 Edge is just so unique-looking - it is the most beautiful phone I've seen in a long time. And contrary to what people might say or what you might think, the two sloped edges are not awkward to handle, does not dig into your skin, and is not uncomfortable to grip. * SCREEN: The very next thing you notice, of course, is the screen. I am continually pleasantly surprised at the evolution of Samsung's AMOLED technology - it has now became the best screen in the industry, hands down. I used to defend the LCD technology of the HTC M7, and at that point it was in fact overall superior to the Samsung S4 because the AMOLED then had issues in the sun, and color reproduction(it was too saturated and not natural). But now, they have fixed those issues, and the S6's screen is just quite simply the best. If you don't believe it, just compare an LG/Samsung OLED TV to any LED TVs today. I still think 5.1 inches for a screen of a PHONE is still too big, but overall, for what smartphones represent nowadays, it is acceptable - we have conditioned ourselves to accept the bigger sizes of smartphones(I remember when I first held a 4.2"" smartphone when it first came out - the HTC HD2 - and thought, ""what the h3ll is this monstrosity??""). * It doesn't hurt that Samsung boosted up the resolution to 1440 x 2560 pixels, which is approximately 577 ppi in pixel density. Although this is quite overkill right now, it's always nice to have the latest and greatest technology - that's the reason why we buy these overpriced phones in the first place, isn't it? It is also very bright, and sunlit legibility is excellent. Color reproduction is quite accurate, and like the S5, you can choose different color modes to suit your liking. *BATTERY LIFE: An important aspect to discuss is the battery life, now more than ever because there is no removable back cover to make replacing the battery easily like before, not to mention there is no microSD slot for you to add memory space to your phone. Comparatively, the S6 Edge is supposed to last a little less than the S6 regular, which I've read is less than last year's S5. But I'm one of those who are always around a charger, and I always carry external battery packs in my backpack when I travel, so that's never a concern. Seriously, who even buys an extra battery anymore - which you can only use for a single specific phone model - when your external battery can charge ANY and ALL phones and tablets?? This scenario only makes sense if your work is so demanding that you don't have extra time to charge the phone, and need to swap batteries IMMEDIATELY. I don't think that scenario is realistic nowadays when external batteries are so small, light, and cheap.

Read plenty of online reviews about the Edge before preordering it, most mentioned the ""gimmick"" that is the curved screen because of lack of functionality. To my mind this is a little like saying flat panel computer monitors were a gimmick because they did everything a CRT did -- they showed the picture, after all, they were just skinnier. ""All show, folks, nothing here to see, move along..."" Not so much. Now, what is a gimmick is the software that has been developed in order fend off complaints that the curved screen's real-estate isn't used efficiently. Edge contacts? Not all that essential or useful. Edge notifications? Same deal. What is really impressive is the effect the curved screen has on my viewing experience. One reviewer on another site wrote ""...gives the disturbing impression that the screen is falling away from me."" I balked at this because my experience is precisely the opposite, specifically that the screen is rising up to me. I hesitate to call it a 3D experience because that cheapens a true 3D display through something like MagicLeap, but it truly gives the impression that the screen has depth...because, well, it does. This is particularly noticed when using ""carousels"" to swipe through items on mobile websites & apps, e.g. Netflix. The items roll up one side of the screen then off the other to produce a more immersive experience. Same can be said about scrolling on Web pages while in landscape mode. Another cool/useful effect is when watching videos the ""edge"" is blacked out preventing distortion of the image but also provides a little extra screen space for widescreen movies. Also when swiping down to check notifications/battery life the notification & progress bar make use of the edge; in effect using less screen space & obscuring less of the video. The QHD display is also excellent with no pixellation visible under a hand lens. Enough about the screen. Processor & RAM make Android 5.0 run like a dream. I owned an S5 before picking up this gem & seriously regretted updating to Lollipop because the S5 just didn't handle it well -- abominable battery life, laaaaag, & it required multiple restarts through the day. None of these problems are evident on the S6. Battery life is good, but not excellent. Can stream videos for about six hours before it needs to be charged & survives a typical day with intermittent usage for ten to twelve hours. The real improvement here is the inclusion of wireless charging. I decided to forego the add-on backplate/battery for the S5 so I picked up a few wireless charging options this go around & I'm thrilled with the functionality. I have one in my car, on the end table, the bedside table & my desk. The convenience of being able to just drop/dock-&-go cannot be overstated & as a result my battery is seldom below 70%. The only improvement I can imagine is if they could figure out how to make my body a wireless charger. TouchWiz is a bit of a let-down, but not significantly so. It is stripped down so I'm not completely inundated with an UI that had the feeling of being added to with each iteration to ""improve"" it, as if adding every spice in the cupboard makes for a better soup. The app drawer is my biggest irritation because it is entirely inconvenient. Newly installed apps are added to the end of the list but apps can be sorted into alphabetical order by touching the A-Z at the top of the list. Now why is this irritating? First, it needs to be done each time you install an app. Second, while you can customize the app list to include your most frequently accessed apps on the first page so you don't have an entire screen dedicated to app icons that should properly be housed in the app drawer, the customization process is poorly designed, unintuitive & languid in end-user implementation. Third, after spending a great deal of time customizing the first page of the app drawer the next time you want to sort your apps alphabetically you lose all of your customization.

I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. Samsung Galaxy S6 tries to be a revolutionary, but it is evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. So do check local specs. I played around with both S6 and S6 Edge for few days and my opinions are based on this. There are tons of reviews going into lot of details, so I am focused on few other aspects like what’s out there and how to compare specs. First Big Changes: No microSD or removable battery. I know many of you loyal Samsung fans says BUMMER! I was a die hard fan of Samsung till S4, then I went to LG G2/G3. I think this is the best bet for S6 to pull it off after a dismal year for Samsung last year. I was very curious to try out S6 and HTC One M9 as they are most talked about now. Many manufacturers are going away from microSD card slots and this is absolutely a must and is a key differentiator from iPhone. I am really sad Samsung decided to drop microSD card slot as well as no removable battery. Why?! Screen is a beauty on S6 – Just Gorgeous. Just go to a retail store and feel it! The Edge feature is still gimmicky. Unlike Note Edge, this has both sides so less dorky but still I am not sold yet. Unless you have loads of money, I will shy away from it for one more year and get it next year when they polish it up. It is certainly fancy and nice to show off, but I would rather buy an Android wear watch like Motorola 360 or Samsung Gear or LG R series. I like Motorola 360 but waiting for version 2 to appear. I like Round watches. IF YOU HAVE LAST YEAR model of any phone, PLEASE DON’T upgrade. Phones are becoming so standard and power packed it makes no sense to upgrade and waste money every year. I buy and sell so many phones as it is like a hobby for me, but I stick to one phone as primary for couple of years now. My main requirements are a 128 GB microSD, good screen, battery life and performance. I am trying hard to see if I can live without one. S6 and S6 Edge comes in a 128 GB variant and I will wait for prices to stabilize on this model. In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size, weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice.

3 of 3 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 13, 2015","I couldn't wait until April 27th, so I purchased this phone at full price from Verizon. Oh, man, where to start!! This phone is the best Android powered phone I have ever used. From the unboxing forward, you immediately get the impression that this is a premium device, which it is. The screen curves gracefully away at the sides, giving the impression of a borderless display. The sides are so thin and beautiful, with the aluminum and chamfered edges. The white pearl color looks stunning. As I reluctantly sever my gaze, there are a few points about it's performance that are worth mentioning. * Speed: Apps launch instantly; definitely as fast as an iPhone. * Software: Android 5.0 Lollipop is preinstalled. Samsung has apparently drawn inspiration from it, because most of the Samsung apps and the Touchwiz UI is actually tolerable, and actually pleasant. The flat, colorful design is seamlessly carried through all the menus. * Fingerprint sensor: It works much better than the S5. I estimate about 85% of the time, it only takes one tap of your finger. No more swiping is necessary. * Fast charging: This may not be important to everyone, because the battery actually lasts all day with normal use. If you use the charger that is included in the box, or any charger that supports Adaptive Fast Charging, it will charge your phone to 100% in about an hour. The Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge is a completely redesigned phone. It is better in almost every way. The only possible cons are that the removable battery and MicroSD card slot are gone. It seems like Samsung is heading in a different direction with design, and I love it. This is a very capable phone, and I would recommend it to anyone. It is definitely worth the asking price and more.",Aaron,Samsung_S6,1045
3 of 3 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 10, 2015","The choice to go with Glass and Aluminum makes this phone's appearance and quality appear to be much better than previous models. The button layout is still the same as older Galaxy models but the button presses now have a reassuring click. The frame is still similar to the other styles as it remains curved. The back gorilla glass is not removable and no longer allows for additional storage or easy battery replacements. The camera sticks out quiet a bit and creates a noticeable bulge on the back of the phone. The glass crystal that should protect the camera is not as strong as the sapphire module found on the iPhone line. The S6 is so lightweight and has a slight slippery feel to it. These are some of my first impressions, but I will break it down more in the rest of the review. Display: The 5.1 inch display is a good size for those who don't want a huge phone, but want a nice size screen. It's a quad-HD 2560X1440 resolution which works out to be 577 pixels per square inch. It has a wonderful display with deep blacks and highly vivid colors. You can always change the saturation to tune the color to your preference. It's incredible to watch with it's 2K resolution. The game play on this is awesome as the screen comes to life. It's bright enough to view in outside sunlight, although you get some glare on the screen. The screen is very sensitive to touch, but that's not always a bad thing. Hardware: The processor Exynos 7420 2.1ghz of performance with 3gb ram minimizes lag with lighting fast reactions from one task to the next. Mali graphics processor really enhances game play. The S6 is missing any expansion slots for external micro sd cards. The base storage for this phone is 32gb, with 64gb and 128gb available as a separate model. It's not upgradeable and you've got to decide what storage needs you have before purchase. It does have the best speakers Samsung has ever put out in the past. They are bottom facing speakers and don't give you as much sound as a rear or forward facing speaker would, but it does have a clear loud sound. The S6 has a much better heart rate monitor than other galaxy's, because of the placement of it. The finger print sensor is now a press type not a swipe type. It works much better than previous models. You can wake the phone while pressing and it unlocks the phone quickly when done as one motion. Battery: The battery is smaller than before at 2600mAh. It should be good for all day for most users. However some users may find it needing to be charged during the day. The s6 does support wireless charging. You can set power saving modes at different battery levels to help you get all day on a single charge. Power saving mode will reduce screen brightness, limit CPU performance, reduced frame rate, turn off touch key light, disable vibration and reduce time before the time is turned off after notifications. I really wish they would have improved the battery and given it a bigger battery capacity. This is potentially the biggest disappointment with the phone for me as I am a heavy user. Camera: The 16 megapixel camera on the back is an improvement as well as the 5 megapixel front facing camera. The camera has a Pro mode which adds extra features and effects. The ability to adjust the focus of a shot is great, you can even change it after the fact. It has good low light photo taking ability with both cameras. Video is available is slow mode as well as 4K, but you cannot benefit from HDR as you would in 1080p. HDR auto appears to be to light when you view your photographs. It does create stunning photos in regular lighting conditions. It features motion tracking and auto focus and keeps the image steady with out tapping the screen to refocus. This is the best camera on a Samsung model to date. Software: Touch wiz works flawlessly and the OS seems smooth thanks to the new hardware. Wiz no longer has those annoying sounds, just simple clicks. The setting screen is now decluttered and simpler to use. The lollipo",Justin D Blackburn,Samsung_S6,1046

I purchased this ""Without Service Plan"", I'm already an old AT&T customer on the Grandfather Unlimited Plan. So naturally I did not want to get the phone with a plan. My concern was would my current SIM work as I've heard conflicting answers. The answer is YES!, I get 4G LTE signal. I normally just buy the unlocked versions but could not find one with the the storage and color that I needed/wanted. So for the time being I'll just have to put up with all the bloatware. The battery was somewhat disappointing but after tinkering with app disabling and stopping certain apps from syncing I can get a full day out of it. I give this Five Stars because it's such an upgrade to any phone currently out (In my opinion). I was on the verge of giving it 4 Stars because my HTC One M8 spoiled me with double-tap to sleep/wake. This has some cool wake features like voice and hovering your hand over the display but I find both features are not as responsive as a simple double-tap. Maybe a Custom ROM or a Software Update might add this feature but I'm not holding my breathe on the latter. All-in-all superb phone that I will probably be using until the next best comes out.

10 of 13 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 10, 2015","I originally picked up this Galaxy S6 Edge because of the unique look; but, the more I use it, the more I like it! I've been using Samsung Galaxy phones for several years now; but, I was seriously considering moving on to a competitor until I saw the new S6 Edge. Let me say that this phone not only looks great - it backs up the looks with a fantastic phone! [*** Curved Edge ***] The S6 is an awesome phone, but is the curved edge worth the extra cost? Personally, I see 4 advantages to the curved edge: 1) It looks cool! If you're looking for a unique phone, then this is one of the most unique designs on the market. 2) The alarm clock feature is awesome! I've been using my phone as an alarm clock (like most people), but I've also missed being able to glance over to see the time. (I mean, who doesn't want to confirm that they still have 5 more hours of sleep?) If you consider that a docking alarm clock can easily cost $100 - then this phone starts to seem like a better deal. 3) Without a case, this phone is a little awkward to pick up off a table; but, with a case it's actually easier to hold and handle. This is definitely something I wasn't expecting. 4) The phone feels extremely thin with the curved edge! As a result, it fits great in my pocket and is easy to hold. There are some other features that the curved edge offers (like the colored contact notifications) - but I haven't found them to be overly useful. On top of that, it does tend to be more reflective outside since there are 3 angles catching the sun. I'm glad I went with the Edge, but I can see how that could be a pro or a con depending on who is looking at it. >>> [*** Update 4/19/2015 ***] <<< Finding a screen protector for the Edge turned out to be a bit harder than I expected - and I finally got sick of the one that I initially got with the phone and tried some others. Anyway, if you are looking for a good screen protector, I would highly recommend trying the IQ Shield LiQuidSkin protector. It does a great job of protecting the screen without interfering with the curved edge. [*** Wireless Charging ***] Even with my S5, I used a Qi Receiver Card - and I have to admit that wireless charging is extremely convenient. Fortunately, the S6 has wireless charging built in - and I definitely recommend giving it a try if you get this phone! The main things to keep in mind with wireless charging are: 1) Thick cases do negatively impact wireless charging - so I'd recommend a case that isn't overly bulky. (There are lots of protective cases for the S6 edge that aren't bulky: like the Spigen Neo Hybrid case.) 2) Even though wireless charging is extremely convenient, it's definitely slower than wired charging - so it's not great for a quick charge if you're nearing empty. Personally, I keep a wireless charging pad on my desk at work and by my nightstand. I can just drop the S6 on the charger whenever it looks like the phone is going to start running low. The wireless charging on this phone is more sensitive, and works far better, than using a Qi adapter with the S5 phone. [*** Wired Charging ***] Although I prefer wireless charging, the wired charging performance of the S6 Edge is amazing! When you use wired charging devices, be sure to verify that they're compatible with the Quick Charge 2.0 standard. With my Quick Charge Car Charger, I can get from empty to half full in a matter of minutes! [*** Non-Removable Battery ***] This phone does NOT have a removable battery, so battery life is more important than ever. So far, the S6 Edge seems to have pretty comparable battery life to my previous Galaxy S5 - although I have't done any scientific testing. When combined with the convenience of wireless charging, the battery life isn't an issue at all for me. Having said that, the bigger issue is that I can't easily replace the battery if it dies. Last year, both my phone and my wife's required a battery replacement; and, although it's possible with the S6 Edge, it's definitely not as eas",D. Matheny,Samsung_S6,1049

While last year's S5 took many steps in the right direction(being somewhat waterproof with better material and craftsmanship), it still wasn't there to make it a mouth-watering phone yet, like what HTC did when they first introduced their One M7, or whenever Apple introduces a new iPhone size. This year, Samsung has finally learned from both of their competitors, and made a phone that has all the good qualities of both, plus some of their own. Finally, this is the Galaxy S that you've always wanted and been dreaming of. * LOOKS/FORM-FACTOR/MATERIALS: The very first thing you notice when you handle the phone, is its new design and form factor - finally Samsung has completed their transformation of getting rid of all that ugly plastic parts. Now it is just all glass and metal, and now it is truly beautiful. The metal fully wraps around the edges ofthe phone. The back is beautiful, the sides are beautiful - heck, even the buttons are beautiful. It feels great in the hand, and oozes style and sophistication. The S6 Edge is just so unique-looking - it is the most beautiful phone I've seen in a long time. And contrary to what people might say or what you might think, the two sloped edges are not awkward to handle, does not dig into your skin, and is not uncomfortable to grip. * SCREEN: The very next thing you notice, of course, is the screen. I am continually pleasantly surprised at the evolution of Samsung's AMOLED technology - it has now became the best screen in the industry, hands down. I used to defend the LCD technology of the HTC M7, and at that point it was in fact overall superior to the Samsung S4 because the AMOLED then had issues in the sun, and color reproduction(it was too saturated and not natural). But now, they have fixed those issues, and the S6's screen is just quite simply the best. If you don't believe it, just compare an LG/Samsung OLED TV to any LED TVs today. I still think 5.1 inches for a screen of a PHONE is still too big, but overall, for what smartphones represent nowadays, it is acceptable - we have conditioned ourselves to accept the bigger sizes of smartphones(I remember when I first held a 4.2"" smartphone when it first came out - the HTC HD2 - and thought, ""what the h3ll is this monstrosity??""). * It doesn't hurt that Samsung boosted up the resolution to 1440 x 2560 pixels, which is approximately 577 ppi in pixel density. Although this is quite overkill right now, it's always nice to have the latest and greatest technology - that's the reason why we buy these overpriced phones in the first place, isn't it? It is also very bright, and sunlit legibility is excellent. Color reproduction is quite accurate, and like the S5, you can choose different color modes to suit your liking. *BATTERY LIFE: An important aspect to discuss is the battery life, now more than ever because there is no removable back cover to make replacing the battery easily like before, not to mention there is no microSD slot for you to add memory space to your phone. Comparatively, the S6 Edge is supposed to last a little less than the S6 regular, which I've read is less than last year's S5. But I'm one of those who are always around a charger, and I always carry external battery packs in my backpack when I travel, so that's never a concern. Seriously, who even buys an extra battery anymore - which you can only use for a single specific phone model - when your external battery can charge ANY and ALL phones and tablets?? This scenario only makes sense if your work is so demanding that you don't have extra time to charge the phone, and need to swap batteries IMMEDIATELY. I don't think that scenario is realistic nowadays when external batteries are so small, light, and cheap. My S6 goes from 100% at 10 am to about 20% at 10 pm with moderate use - so no complaints there. I get home, plug it up, and there are no issues. * What's better this year, is the wireless charging standards are already built into th",Johnny Amazon®,Samsung_S6,1051

It was a phone I was using overseas and was expecting to be a good solid phone but it was not. I was able to get an LG G3 sent out to me and liked it much better. When I got back to the US I got an HTC ONE M9 and it was just ok. In my opinion it was not a phone worthy of being a flagship. So I wasn't happy with that and I knew the G4 was coming out soon and saw the leaks and it really didn't seem any better the the G3 (except for the camera and display). So I decided to try and go to that Galaxy S6. To my surprise I loved it. Everything I hated about that S5 was gone. I think the build quality is amazing, it has a excellent display and it is a very fast and fluid phone. The battery life is descent. The battery was better then the HTC One M9, LG G3 and S5 in my use. Honestly it became more iPhone like which I know a lot of people knock on this device but in my opinion is a great thing. The phone feels very refined and has an excellent feel to it. I then found an S6 Edge for a great price and decided to compare the normal S6 to the S6 Edge. I was going to sell the one that I didn't like as much. I am going to be bluntly honest the Edge features are not worth anywhere close to the extra $100 however to me the display on the S6 Edge looked like a higher quality display. Things looked noticeably better on it. It might just me my imagination but it looks better to me. So basically the only reason that you would buy the HTC ONE M9 over the S6 or S6 Edge would be for the micro sd card slot in it and you absolutely could not live without it. To me the HTC ONE M9 in every other way is inferior to the S6 and S6 edge. The LG G4 also has a micro sd card slot and it has a removable battery but I cant really compare it to the S6 because I have never used it. The S6 is available up to 128GB but it would have been nice to have the option for micro sd. So to sum things up the S6 and S6 Edge were surprisingly good phones and it has made in my opinion the best phone in the market.",smithersop,Samsung_S6,1052

I have an iPhone 4 through work and personally has a Samsung S3 ... I hated that phone!! On more than one occasion, I was tempted to take a hammer to it! Siri on the iPhone was SO superior when doing a search, getting directions and more. Some times the S3 couldn't even find an often called name in my phone directory. So that's where I was headed, when after some research I came across a review of the S6 Edge by an Apple devotee and iPhone lover. He was blown away by the Edge. This phone is nothing like its predecessors. It is intuitive, Getting directions happens in split seconds and in fact faster and more accurate than the navigation system in my car. This phone is sleek (slippery in hand too!) This is a very robust OS on the phone, so be prepared to speend some time learning all of the enhancements and features you aren't accustomed to. At my workplace, we all have iPhone company phones. The VP came back from a family trip in Europe, where his daughter met up with them and had her new S6 Edge. He was blown away, especially with the picture quality. And pictures and video quality is outstanding! He and I got our iPhones together and the first thing he said to me is ""When is our two years up so I can get the S6 Edge?"" As to some of the complaints referenced here by a few people, I've not experienced any of that. I wanted the gold platinum version which wasn't available for several weeks- a month or more maybe after the initial shipment of the white and black phones to retailers. A secondary thought I had was that if there were any software/hardware issues with the initial release, it would get picked up by Samsung and corrected. As previously mentioned, this phone is so smmoth, it's actually a little slippery to handle, so be sure to get the Speigen cover ( I think it was the Ultra Hybrid). And if you get the gold platinum like I did, get the clear Speigen cover as it takes nothing away from the beauty of the phone. Otherwise, the black case from them, which I mistakenly ordered and returned was a superior case and much cheaper than anything you'll buy at the Verizon, AT&T or Best Buy stores.

But I can say that the camera on this phone is light years ahead of that of the HTC One M8 and from articles I have read, the One M9. The finger print scanner works great. In a fraction of the time it would take me to input a code, I have secure access to my phone using just my thumb. I love technology and this keeps snooping eyes away from my data. Just remember to encrypt as Android 5.0 Lollipop does a much better job of encryption than previous versions. Aesthetically, this phone is beautiful and with the edges, stands apart from the rest. You know you have the best looking phone on the market when sporting this. So why the 3 stars? The touch screen on the edges, specifically the left has me flustered. I am a two handed texter and without fail on every keyboard I have tried, including Swift Key, Google and the stock Samsung keyboard, my left palm skin right at the webbing at the base of my index to my thumb keeps hitting the left edge of the keyboard toggling over to numbers and special characters. Reviews I read said that the Edge wasn't supposed to pickup palms. Mine does and every time I type a sentence and reach for the ""g"" or anything around it, I toggle over to numbers/characters. It is maddening. This is literally my only complaint and it is a major one as it effects one of the primary uses of my beautiful device. I have to hold the phone at an awkward angle to avoid skin contact on that edge. The software is still dealing with the Lollipop Ram handling issue even with the recent 5.0.1 update. I don't blame the phone for this as it is pretty much all Lollipop based phones right now. I will update if I find a cure. In the interim, I paired my S6 Edge with a UAG Armor Gear case which I love http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TRG8KGY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 after first trying out the base model Rineke Fusion case http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TJ3DZA6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1 which just didn't offer the protection I was looking for. It was slippery and seemed way too thin.",viperphi,Samsung_S6,1054

1 of 1 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on July 30, 2015","I purchased the gold Samsung S6 Edge 64 gig from Best Buy last week. I traded in the Samsung S3. So I was good and ready for a new phone :-). I absolutely love this phone. It is amazing how much faster this device operates. I say that every time I upgrade a phone :-). I started to have all sorts of issues with my S3. It started rebooting on me in the middle of phone calls. It would just freeze as well. I think some of this may have been caused by the Mobile Iron encryption software that my employer forced us to install if we wanted company email. I don't have it installed on this phone. Pros - The phone is slick looking in gold. Really cool. The picture on the Samsung website looks better than the actual phone but that is the same for a picture of a Burger King Whopper. - The GUI is so much better. I liked the S3 and I am impressed that things could be improved so much. For instance, I can take a picture when the phone is locked. Thank goodness!!! I really like split screen. That is wonderful. - The phone charges really fast with the Adaptive Fast Charger it comes with. -The functionality of the Edge Clock is great. I set the clock to show up on the edge of the phone at night. The Samsung Note has more edge functionality that this phone done. Some could argue that a $100 increase in price between the S6 and S6 Edge may not be worth it. I some ways I would agree. - The camera and video are so much better than my S3. - I could not use mobile data while on a call. The folks at Best Buy told me Verizon no longer offered mobile data while on the phone. They said I would need to switch to Sprint or T-Mobile. That sounded lame so I called Verizon. They explained to me that I had to go into settings and turn on advanced calling. Once I did that I was able to check email and use the internet while on a phone call. This was a deal breaker for me if that feature was truly gone. - It is working well with the Samsung Gear Fit. I have not had any issues with that. - The fingerprint lock works well. I haven't used one on a phone before. - The Edge People option is neat especially when the phone is on silent. At first I didn't think there were enough color options but anymore than that and I would not remember which color belonged to who. - The Help Videos on the phone are really helpful. Cons - I read today that Samsung is going to cut prices for the phone. So I probably paid too much. - I have been having a hard time getting the type of case I want because the phone is so new. I want the Mophie case but they have not provided a date when the case the ship. - It does not have a memory expansion slot. I had to copy the data I had on the card to some place else. But, that is not the end of the world.",Charmina,Samsung_S6,1061
1 of 1 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on June 8, 2015","I will keep it short and to the point, I love this phone. I bought an S4 when it was released, and immediately popped a 16 GB memory card in the back and never took it out after owning it for two years. I always used the factory battery, and didn't see the need to swap it out (have to turn off the phone anyway to do this). If you really need those features (and don't just think you do), get an S5, but I expect most don't really need those features. I bought the phone off contract and had to pay full price (disclaimer is I work for SSI and received a discount off the phone, but even if I hadn't I would have been willing to pay full price). I had the opportunity to handle both the Edge and non Edge phones in the store before buying, and preferred the slightly sharper edges to the Edge phone, they hold better in my hand and don't slip down, so I bought the Edge. Lets not kid anyone, the edges for show only, the clock function and edge colors are pointless, and stroking the edge to make the clock starts is so finicky that it is faster just to turn on the phone. The phone was easy to setup, very responsive compared to my S4. The camera starts in no time, the new interface is slick and smooth, and performance of the phone is stunning. The look and build quality of the phone is at the top level, as good as any competitor, and actually the phone isn't prone to bending like certain other phones (A friend has one of those phones, and it did in fact bend after a short while from light use in a pocket). To be fair, my S4 had this problem as well. I am blown away by camera image quality, as good as any point and shoot. I don't play many games on this phone, so didn't really need the processor performance, although this does give real time HDR video as well as 4k video lacking in most competitors. When I do play the occasional game I am blown away how fast this is. Call quality is good, as with any phone, holding in certain ways can hurt call quality since the antenna is internal to the phone. I only have a problem with this in rare cases when I hold the phone with my fingers on the back in building with weak signal strength. It isn't a problem, I switch to holding the phone normally if someone can't hear me. Battery life of this phone is excellent. Some reports complain that it is a tiny fraction smaller than the S5 battery, and that is true, but it is still much larger than the main competitor's battery and has no problem lasting 1 or 2 days of moderate use. The adaptive quick charger included can charge this phone so fast that battery life is really of no concern for most users. Literally, 20 minutes on the charger and the phone is half charged again. I haven't bothered with wireless yet (too slow). I love the pedometer, it seems accurate enough for its purpose, and the heart-rate monitor is much better than the one in my Gear S (which I don't wear much). The red light does a better job detecting pulse than the green light in the Gear. My only complaint about the design of the phone is that hair can sometimes get trapped between the metal and glass and it will pull when you take the phone away from your head, but this is pretty rare and only if you rub it up through your hair or something (like bored and fidgeting). Now I hope Samsung is quick to release their Payment option, as I think ability to use it with any mag strip card reader puts it way ahead of the competition. Finally, I found this phone has an IR blaster on it, meaning you can use it as a universal remote for almost all of your TV and other entertainment needs. The Peel app is pretty decent and has schedules, reminders, favorites, and a huge supply of devices you can program it to work with. All of my devices worked fine. It can even do more complicated things like let the volume switch adjust the amplifier, and the channel button works on your TV. You can also setup multiple rooms for different profiles. This is way handier than I would have thought, although more flexibili",Eric T,Samsung_S6,1062
1 of 1 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 13, 2015","X-posted. Read plenty of online reviews about the Edge before preordering it, most mentioned the ""gimmick"" that is the curved screen because of lack of functionality. To my mind this is a little like saying flat panel computer monitors were a gimmick because they did everything a CRT did -- they showed the picture, after all, they were just skinnier. ""All show, folks, nothing here to see, move along..."" Not so much. Now, what is a gimmick is the software that has been developed in order fend off complaints that the curved screen's real-estate isn't used efficiently. Edge contacts? Not all that essential or useful. Edge notifications? Same deal. What is really impressive is the effect the curved screen has on my viewing experience. One reviewer on another site wrote ""...gives the disturbing impression that the screen is falling away from me."" I balked at this because my experience is precisely the opposite, specifically that the screen is rising up to me. I hesitate to call it a 3D experience because that cheapens a true 3D display through something like MagicLeap, but it truly gives the impression that the screen has depth...because, well, it does. This is particularly noticed when using ""carousels"" to swipe through items on mobile websites & apps, e.g. Netflix. The items roll up one side of the screen then off the other to produce a more immersive experience. Same can be said about scrolling on Web pages while in landscape mode. Another cool/useful effect is when watching videos the ""edge"" is blacked out preventing distortion of the image but also provides a little extra screen space for widescreen movies. Also when swiping down to check notifications/battery life the notification & progress bar make use of the edge; in effect using less screen space & obscuring less of the video. The QHD display is also excellent with no pixellation visible under a hand lens. Enough about the screen. Processor & RAM make Android 5.0 run like a dream. I owned an S5 before picking up this gem & seriously regretted updating to Lollipop because the S5 just didn't handle it well -- abominable battery life, laaaaag, & it required multiple restarts through the day. None of these problems are evident on the S6. Battery life is good, but not excellent. Can stream videos for about six hours before it needs to be charged & survives a typical day with intermittent usage for ten to twelve hours. The real improvement here is the inclusion of wireless charging. I decided to forego the add-on backplate/battery for the S5 so I picked up a few wireless charging options this go around & I'm thrilled with the functionality. I have one in my car, on the end table, the bedside table & my desk. The convenience of being able to just drop/dock-&-go cannot be overstated & as a result my battery is seldom below 70%. The only improvement I can imagine is if they could figure out how to make my body a wireless charger. TouchWiz is a bit of a let-down, but not significantly so. It is stripped down so I'm not completely inundated with an UI that had the feeling of being added to with each iteration to ""improve"" it, as if adding every spice in the cupboard makes for a better soup. The app drawer is my biggest irritation because it is entirely inconvenient. Newly installed apps are added to the end of the list but apps can be sorted into alphabetical order by touching the A-Z at the top of the list. Now why is this irritating? First, it needs to be done each time you install an app. Second, while you can customize the app list to include your most frequently accessed apps on the first page so you don't have an entire screen dedicated to app icons that should properly be housed in the app drawer, the customization process is poorly designed, unintuitive & languid in end-user implementation. Third, after spending a great deal of time customizing the first page of the app drawer the next time you want to sort your apps alphabetically you lose all of your customization.

Seems already having beginning of screen burn in like my s5 did in 4 months. I've had 3 warranty replacements through AT&T all with pink uneven tint in the screen best seen in lower light and looking dead on at it. Best Buy sent back a whole batch in St. Louis after I returned my first one that was SO PINK ON BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN THAT THEY COULDN'T DENY, then opened 3 boxes to find they were ALL bad and wouldn't open anymore and said whole batch would be bad. Then I went to AT&T to purchase because I was DETERMINED to have this beautiful phone! Only thing I got there was a little less pink and a few reps refusing to admit that they see it! Took a few times going to several corp stores to get the right person to see and admit defect! Then they said had ONE more in stock powered it up to a white screen and they said themself ""well this one looks worse than yours, I wouldn't exchange"" oh, lol so now you see it! Samsung and AT&T deny any ""known"" issue with this, well Google it ppl there are SO many ppl on xda 89 pages of ppl with the same issue! Besides taking 3 back to the store and the 3 warranty now I'm dealing with asurion since my son did what I felt like doing myself and busted it. So now asurion has sent 3 scratched ones, 2 pink ones, and one that looked like it had paint run under the glass! I've had brand new s6 edge 64 gb gold out of the box new that had the hole in the glass for the camera on front SO far off I wander where do they do that at lol! QC went out the window on a great phone because they rushed through them when running out of particular models sooner than expected. Take a good look at your screen ppl when it's on white or light gray background. I'm typing on one right now that has 2 bright streaks horizontally in the middle. Once seen cannot be unseen! But now I'm dealing with asurion and wanting a new one which they say everyone does but I want a new one not just because my device was new but because I want a fresh batch to see if it's possible that Samsung fixed what the cause of this hardware defect is in production because regardless if they admit it, it's a VERY known issue and had the whole stock of St. Louis, MO area which is large sent back! Oh, they know! I wish I could off just passed on the beautiful phone and stuck with my great s5 that is dust and water resistant and now running great after update. Has extra battery in my purse. And 64 gb sd card so if it got smashed whatever pics on that card would still be safe if card was not damaged. Makes me wander where if I don't back up every pic via internet would my pics end up of this phone took a dive in the pool? Recently had my kids at the pool and kept this SO far from water and put up getting VERY few pics wandering at that time why I'd ever pay so much for SO much less functionality/practicality that is only going to be covered up by a case anyway! I have a clear one on now to enjoy the beautiful phone but really it's not all that!",Stephanie C.,Samsung_S6,1074

Plus, with 128gb internal storage I was sure that I could do anything with this behemoth. Samsung through in some extras like: free Themes, a free One Drive account, and a heart rate/ pulse oximeter (reads the O2 saturation in your blood). I have had the phone for 3 days and it constantly over heats to an astounding 168 degrees even when I wasn't charging it. The battery life was horrible and because of the overheating issue the phone had tremendous lag. The 64bit Octa Core Processor was overworked while browsing, playing games, listening to music, and not to mention multi-tasking (as it was meant to do). I have young children and the phone was a burn hazard. My family and friends were at risk every time they viewed their favorite videos or scroll through the photo album or used the device for calls. I tried downloading apps to boost the phone and cool it down but none of them worked. On top of the regular power saving mode Samsung installed an ""Ultra Power Saving Mode"" to extend the battery life even further. In this mode several key features are disabled and you can still make and receive calls and messages. The only time the device was safe to use was when it was in Ultra Power Saving Mode. To sum it up. I would not recommend this device to anyone. This was Samsung's ""Flagship"". Wait until the S7 comes out and Samsung has had a chance to work on the safety issues. P.S. Samsung was aware of the safety concerns and failed to address the issue. The Galaxy series has had heating issues in the past. In the S6 the battery and processor don't have a way to breath. So, as this electronic device does what it is designed to do it creates heat. For electronics to work properly there must be proper ventilation. Samsung failed to respect this common factor neglecting to include a way for the heat to escape. Users can no-longer remove the back cover to remove the battery neither are there any slits for air to circulate. Samsung designed the device to be water resistant and dangerous.",N,Samsung_S6,1075

I originally gave my new Edge phone 2 stars because of all of the issues it had.. the inverted camera.. being told it was not a software, easily fixed problem.. and how the auto rotation didn't work. BUT! Samsung has fixed all of the issues and so I changed my rating to 5 stars because I absolutely love my phone. I love the quality... the feel of it.. I love the edge vs. the regular S6.. I love the gold color. I'm very happy with my phone. It has amazing features.. the graphics are awesome.. Love it! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ SOOOO DISAPPOINTED! Don't get me wrong.. the sleek design.. the new features.. are excellent! BUT.. the camera is upside down. Everything, the camera and keys are all inverted. It makes it very difficult to take pictures. When I called customer service for Samsung, they told me I was the ""first person with this problem"".. (not!).. and told me the only thing they would do is have me send it in to them and they'll send me out a refurbished phone. My phone is less than a week old, and they want me to be happy with a refurbished one? (not!) After contacting the Verizon store where I purchased the phone, they told me they can order me a new Edge S6 phone, BUT.. I will not get a new 14 day warranty. SO! If it takes more than 10 days for them to receive the new order, I don't even have 5 minutes of warranty on the new phone and no one can guarantee me that the new phone will work. If you google about the camera being inverted, there are a LOT of unsatisfied customers with the same complaint. And while I absolutely love the graphics, design, ease of use.... I can not have an upside camera. So, I'm returning my Edge and going back to my old phone. IF they ever fix the inverted camera issue, I'll be the first one in line to purchase one again. Verizon is saying it is a hardware issue, so the fix is in getting a new phone. They said it's not going to be a simple software update issue to fix the inverted camera. At least that's what one Verizon employee told me. I'm very disappointed with the customer service and refusal to give me a new 14 day warranty with a new phone.. especially knowing this phone has issues.

2 of 3 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on May 4, 2015","Before I start this review I must admit that I absolutely disliked Samsung devices prior to this phone. With a cluttered software that only caused frustration while using their phone on a daily basis, I stayed away from Samsung when it came to cellular devices. However with the new S6, Samsung has promised that they have toned down their software, also known as Touchwiz by 40%. A promise of no lag experience and a simpler UI, Samsung plans to win back their older fans and rise back to the top. Did they achieve their goals? Let's find out. Pros Display - With a Quad HD super AMOLED display, there is not a single phone in the industry as of now that can compete. With a pixel density of 577 pixels per inch, this is the most vibrant and beautiful display you can acquire. The colors are accurate, the white can be somewhat on the yellow side but that can be altered through the settings. With auto brightness, the screen can go as bright as 600 nits, which makes it extremely easy to read under bright lights. The screen itself is 5.1 inches but almost creates a no bezel experience due to the edge screens. Design - This has to be the most improved category for Samsung. As a company Samsung has always functioned under the philosophy of function over aesthetics. However after a disappointing year last year, Samsung reevaluated their approach as a company. They have thrown aside the plastic builds of past phones and has finally entered the world of premium and luxury. With a gorgeous pair of Gorilla glass 4 covering both the front and back of the phone, it creates a seamless feel on the hand like none other. Both pieces of glass are secured in place by a beautiful Aluminum outer rim that feels cold to the touch every time you pick it up.The buttons are snappy and very clicky and the edges of the outer aluminum rim are polished. Samsung has put great attention to detail that matches and reflects the quality of finishing as other luxurious jewelry. Thanks to the bent edges, the phone feels very slim.However one drawback of the glass body is that it picks up a lot of fingerprints. Luckily if you prefer the white color variation, the finger prints do not show at all. So if you are someone like me who does not like cases on their phones, the white color is the safest bet which is I personally purchased the white variation myself. Performance - What an improvement did Samsung make. With their new iteration of Touchwiz software, samsung had shed off over 40% of bloatware and created an almost lag free experience. I mention lag free because when the phone is in use for longer periods of time, it can become warm and causes lag here and there, but not a deal breaker. I like to be honest so I mention everything. Multitasking has never been better. Even though it is a small real estate in terms of screen size, running two programs at once is completely lag free and enables you to take care of various tasks and save time. Camera - This camera is hands down the best camera in phones as of now. The colors are crisp, the details it captures are astonishing, and most importantly it is fast. The interface itself is very minimal. With double clicking on the home button, it opens up the camera under 0.5 seconds. The software itself is so good, if you are someone who just prefers a camera for point and shoot, I feel very comfortable in saying this phone will replace any cameras you have lying around the house for that purpose (Disregard DSLR cameras etc.). With the addition of f1.9 lens, lowlight pictures are better than ever. Even though they tend to be over exposed, the picture itself comes out very clear. This is an incredible camera and I cannot stretch that enough. I've had people mistake my pictures for DSLR, yup it's that good. My only beef is the front facing camera (FFC abbreviated). Even though the FFC is really good in it's own right, the software tends to create a air brushed finish when taking selfies. This causes a somewhat unnatural look on your",Sayeef Khan,Samsung_S6,1077

Wish all of these carriers/colors/memory existed on one page. *nudge amazon* Read plenty of online reviews about the Edge before preordering it, most mentioned the ""gimmick"" that is the curved screen because of lack of functionality. To my mind this is a little like saying flat panel computer monitors were a gimmick because they did everything a CRT did -- they showed the picture, after all, they were just skinnier. ""All show, folks, nothing here to see, move along..."" Not so much. Now, what is a gimmick is the software that has been developed in order fend off complaints that the curved screen's real-estate isn't used efficiently. Edge contacts? Not all that essential or useful. Edge notifications? Same deal. What is really impressive is the effect the curved screen has on my viewing experience. One reviewer on another site wrote ""...gives the disturbing impression that the screen is falling away from me."" I balked at this because my experience is precisely the opposite, specifically that the screen is rising up to me. I hesitate to call it a 3D experience because that cheapens a true 3D display through something like MagicLeap, but it truly gives the impression that the screen has depth...because, well, it does. This is particularly noticed when using ""carousels"" to swipe through items on mobile websites & apps, e.g. Netflix. The items roll up one side of the screen then off the other to produce a more immersive experience. Same can be said about scrolling on Web pages while in landscape mode. Another cool/useful effect is when watching videos the ""edge"" is blacked out preventing distortion of the image but also provides a little extra screen space for widescreen movies. Also when swiping down to check notifications/battery life the notification & progress bar make use of the edge; in effect using less screen space & obscuring less of the video. The QHD display is also excellent with no pixellation visible under a hand lens. Enough about the screen. Processor & RAM make Android 5.0 run like a dream. I owned an S5 before picking up this gem & seriously regretted updating to Lollipop because the S5 just didn't handle it well -- abominable battery life, laaaaag, & it required multiple restarts through the day. None of these problems are evident on the S6. Battery life is good, but not excellent. Can stream videos for about six hours before it needs to be charged & survives a typical day with intermittent usage for ten to twelve hours. The real improvement here is the inclusion of wireless charging. I decided to forego the add-on backplate/battery for the S5 so I picked up a few wireless charging options this go around & I'm thrilled with the functionality. I have one in my car, on the end table, the bedside table & my desk. The convenience of being able to just drop/dock-&-go cannot be overstated & as a result my battery is seldom below 70%. The only improvement I can imagine is if they could figure out how to make my body a wireless charger. TouchWiz is a bit of a let-down, but not significantly so. It is stripped down so I'm not completely inundated with an UI that had the feeling of being added to with each iteration to ""improve"" it, as if adding every spice in the cupboard makes for a better soup. The app drawer is my biggest irritation because it is entirely inconvenient. Newly installed apps are added to the end of the list but apps can be sorted into alphabetical order by touching the A-Z at the top of the list. Now why is this irritating? First, it needs to be done each time you install an app. Second, while you can customize the app list to include your most frequently accessed apps on the first page so you don't have an entire screen dedicated to app icons that should properly be housed in the app drawer, the customization process is poorly designed, unintuitive & languid in end-user implementation. Third, after spending a great deal of time customizing the first page of the app drawer the next time you want",Amazon Customer,Samsung_S6,1078

The button layout is still the same as older Galaxy models but the button presses now have a reassuring click. The frame is still similar to the other styles as it remains curved. The back gorilla glass is not removable and no longer allows for additional storage or easy battery replacements. The camera sticks out quiet a bit and creates a noticeable bulge on the back of the phone. The glass crystal that should protect the camera is not as strong as the sapphire module found on the iPhone line. The S6 is so lightweight and has a slight slippery feel to it. These are some of my first impressions, but I will break it down more in the rest of the review. Display: The 5.1 inch display is a good size for those who don't want a huge phone, but want a nice size screen. It's a quad-HD 2560X1440 resolution which works out to be 577 pixels per square inch. It has a wonderful display with deep blacks and highly vivid colors. You can always change the saturation to tune the color to your preference. It's incredible to watch with it's 2K resolution. The game play on this is awesome as the screen comes to life. It's bright enough to view in outside sunlight, although you get some glare on the screen. The screen is very sensitive to touch, but that's not always a bad thing. Hardware: The processor Exynos 7420 2.1ghz of performance with 3gb ram minimizes lag with lighting fast reactions from one task to the next. Mali graphics processor really enhances game play. The S6 is missing any expansion slots for external micro sd cards. The base storage for this phone is 32gb, with 64gb and 128gb available as a separate model. It's not upgradeable and you've got to decide what storage needs you have before purchase. It does have the best speakers Samsung has ever put out in the past. They are bottom facing speakers and don't give you as much sound as a rear or forward facing speaker would, but it does have a clear loud sound. The S6 has a much better heart rate monitor than other galaxy's, because of the placement of it. The finger print sensor is now a press type not a swipe type. It works much better than previous models. You can wake the phone while pressing and it unlocks the phone quickly when done as one motion. Battery: The battery is smaller than before at 2600mAh. It should be good for all day for most users. However some users may find it needing to be charged during the day. The s6 does support wireless charging. You can set power saving modes at different battery levels to help you get all day on a single charge. Power saving mode will reduce screen brightness, limit CPU performance, reduced frame rate, turn off touch key light, disable vibration and reduce time before the time is turned off after notifications. I really wish they would have improved the battery and given it a bigger battery capacity. This is potentially the biggest disappointment with the phone for me as I am a heavy user. Camera: The 16 megapixel camera on the back is an improvement as well as the 5 megapixel front facing camera. The camera has a Pro mode which adds extra features and effects. The ability to adjust the focus of a shot is great, you can even change it after the fact. It has good low light photo taking ability with both cameras. Video is available is slow mode as well as 4K, but you cannot benefit from HDR as you would in 1080p. HDR auto appears to be to light when you view your photographs. It does create stunning photos in regular lighting conditions. It features motion tracking and auto focus and keeps the image steady with out tapping the screen to refocus. This is the best camera on a Samsung model to date. Software: Touch wiz works flawlessly and the OS seems smooth thanks to the new hardware. Wiz no longer has those annoying sounds, just simple clicks. The setting screen is now decluttered and simpler to use. The lollipo",Justin D Blackburn,Samsung_S6,1079

While last year's S5 took many steps in the right direction(being somewhat waterproof with better material and craftsmanship), it still wasn't there to make it a mouth-watering phone yet, like what HTC did when they first introduced their One M7, or whenever Apple introduces a new iPhone size. This year, Samsung has finally learned from both of their competitors, and made a phone that has all the good qualities of both, plus some of their own. Finally, this is the Galaxy S that you've always wanted and been dreaming of. * LOOKS/FORM-FACTOR/MATERIALS: The very first thing you notice when you handle the phone, is its new design and form factor - finally Samsung has completed their transformation of getting rid of all that ugly plastic parts. Now it is just all glass and metal, and now it is truly beautiful. The metal fully wraps around the edges ofthe phone. The back is beautiful, the sides are beautiful - heck, even the buttons are beautiful. It feels great in the hand, and oozes style and sophistication. The S6 Edge is just so unique-looking - it is the most beautiful phone I've seen in a long time. And contrary to what people might say or what you might think, the two sloped edges are not awkward to handle, does not dig into your skin, and is not uncomfortable to grip. * SCREEN: The very next thing you notice, of course, is the screen. I am continually pleasantly surprised at the evolution of Samsung's AMOLED technology - it has now became the best screen in the industry, hands down. I used to defend the LCD technology of the HTC M7, and at that point it was in fact overall superior to the Samsung S4 because the AMOLED then had issues in the sun, and color reproduction(it was too saturated and not natural). But now, they have fixed those issues, and the S6's screen is just quite simply the best. If you don't believe it, just compare an LG/Samsung OLED TV to any LED TVs today. I still think 5.1 inches for a screen of a PHONE is still too big, but overall, for what smartphones represent nowadays, it is acceptable - we have conditioned ourselves to accept the bigger sizes of smartphones(I remember when I first held a 4.2"" smartphone when it first came out - the HTC HD2 - and thought, ""what the h3ll is this monstrosity??""). * It doesn't hurt that Samsung boosted up the resolution to 1440 x 2560 pixels, which is approximately 577 ppi in pixel density. Although this is quite overkill right now, it's always nice to have the latest and greatest technology - that's the reason why we buy these overpriced phones in the first place, isn't it? It is also very bright, and sunlit legibility is excellent. Color reproduction is quite accurate, and like the S5, you can choose different color modes to suit your liking. *BATTERY LIFE: An important aspect to discuss is the battery life, now more than ever because there is no removable back cover to make replacing the battery easily like before, not to mention there is no microSD slot for you to add memory space to your phone. Comparatively, the S6 Edge is supposed to last a little less than the S6 regular, which I've read is less than last year's S5. But I'm one of those who are always around a charger, and I always carry external battery packs in my backpack when I travel, so that's never a concern. Seriously, who even buys an extra battery anymore - which you can only use for a single specific phone model - when your external battery can charge ANY and ALL phones and tablets?? This scenario only makes sense if your work is so demanding that you don't have extra time to charge the phone, and need to swap batteries IMMEDIATELY. I don't think that scenario is realistic nowadays when external batteries are so small, light, and cheap. My S6 goes from 100% at 10 am to about 20% at 10 pm with moderate use - so no complaints there. I get home, plug it up, and there are no issues. * What's better this year, is the wireless charging standards are already built into th",Johnny Amazon®,Samsung_S6,1080

I've been using Samsung Galaxy phones for several years now; but, I was seriously considering moving on to a competitor until I saw the new S6 Edge. Let me say that this phone not only looks great - it backs up the looks with a fantastic phone! [*** Curved Edge ***] The S6 is an awesome phone, but is the curved edge worth the extra cost? Personally, I see 4 advantages to the curved edge: 1) It looks cool! If you're looking for a unique phone, then this is one of the most unique designs on the market. 2) The alarm clock feature is awesome! I've been using my phone as an alarm clock (like most people), but I've also missed being able to glance over to see the time. (I mean, who doesn't want to confirm that they still have 5 more hours of sleep?) If you consider that a docking alarm clock can easily cost $100 - then this phone starts to seem like a better deal. 3) Without a case, this phone is a little awkward to pick up off a table; but, with a case it's actually easier to hold and handle. This is definitely something I wasn't expecting. 4) The phone feels extremely thin with the curved edge! As a result, it fits great in my pocket and is easy to hold. There are some other features that the curved edge offers (like the colored contact notifications) - but I haven't found them to be overly useful. On top of that, it does tend to be more reflective outside since there are 3 angles catching the sun. I'm glad I went with the Edge, but I can see how that could be a pro or a con depending on who is looking at it. >>> [*** Update 4/19/2015 ***] <<< Finding a screen protector for the Edge turned out to be a bit harder than I expected - and I finally got sick of the one that I initially got with the phone and tried some others. Anyway, if you are looking for a good screen protector, I would highly recommend trying the IQ Shield LiQuidSkin protector. It does a great job of protecting the screen without interfering with the curved edge. [*** Wireless Charging ***] Even with my S5, I used a Qi Receiver Card - and I have to admit that wireless charging is extremely convenient. Fortunately, the S6 has wireless charging built in - and I definitely recommend giving it a try if you get this phone! The main things to keep in mind with wireless charging are: 1) Thick cases do negatively impact wireless charging - so I'd recommend a case that isn't overly bulky. (There are lots of protective cases for the S6 edge that aren't bulky: like the Spigen Neo Hybrid case.) 2) Even though wireless charging is extremely convenient, it's definitely slower than wired charging - so it's not great for a quick charge if you're nearing empty. Personally, I keep a wireless charging pad on my desk at work and by my nightstand. I can just drop the S6 on the charger whenever it looks like the phone is going to start running low. The wireless charging on this phone is more sensitive, and works far better, than using a Qi adapter with the S5 phone. [*** Wired Charging ***] Although I prefer wireless charging, the wired charging performance of the S6 Edge is amazing! When you use wired charging devices, be sure to verify that they're compatible with the Quick Charge 2.0 standard. With my Quick Charge Car Charger, I can get from empty to half full in a matter of minutes! [*** Non-Removable Battery ***] This phone does NOT have a removable battery, so battery life is more important than ever. So far, the S6 Edge seems to have pretty comparable battery life to my previous Galaxy S5 - although I have't done any scientific testing. When combined with the convenience of wireless charging, the battery life isn't an issue at all for me. Having said that, the bigger issue is that I can't easily replace the battery if it dies. Last year, both my phone and my wife's required a battery replacement; and, although it's possible with the S6 Edge, it's definitely not as eas",D. Matheny,Samsung_S6,1081

That being said, the only feature I desperately wish it had is the water resistance, it's such a practical and useful feature that came in handy numerous times in my gs5, videos, pics in the rain? Snow? Pool? Check. Really hope Samsung puts it on the S7. Software wise honestly it seems as bloated as usual especially on the ATT side but I do appreciate the ability to disable basically any app. Lag wise, I think the very nature of Android is going to keep it one step behind iOS, that being said, I've had very few hiccups, nothing to ruin the enjoyment. In regards to the edge display, think of it like paying $50 for the look/uniqueness and $50 for the usefulness. The edge night clock is good but you'll notice light leaking throughout the screen in the dark which is a little disappointing. In terms of being able the grip the phone or pick it up, I've had zero issues regardless of which way the screen faces. Fingerprint scanner takes 4 prints and works great and can't wait to try out Samsung pay. If you get this phone then definitely get a wireless charger, word of warning though, the glass back makes it slide off the charger it it's at an angle ' and it can only be charged on its back. Battery life is average and lasts me the whole day through moderate use which is all you can expect these days it seems.

This is by far the best android experience I've had so far. I've had every galaxy phone/note except the gs5 and note edge. The newly updated touchwiz ui goes perfectly with lollipop. Finally samsung has stopped trying to be the jack of all trades and master of none. Trust me, i had no problem skipping gs5 because i felt it was trash. If you're on the fence go to a local bestbuy or cell phone store and try it out. You'll definitely make a decision once you do. In my opinion getting either the s6 or edge is a win. The camera is an absolute beast!. Also dont be concerned with no micro sd card or a swappable battery. This mofo comes with a rapid charger that is amazing not to mention that the battery on the edge is slightly larger than the s6. I've been able to manage 13 hours on a single charge with moderate to heavy use at times. Im an engineer so im in a plant with a lot of machinery so im sure that plays a part in my phone continuously trying to maintain a strong signal which will affect battery life. Those who complain about swappable batteries are severly in the minority. Buy a mophie juice pack or an actual phone case that doubles as a juice pack. Do that and u can charge the phone while protecting it. Not to mention you can leave the case charging in an office or car and it uses the same charger as your phone! 32gb is more memory than most will ever need.

,5,,"on September 21, 2015","Samsung’s new Galaxy S6 Edge is a smartphone that gives you optimal performance and a beautifully crafted design. Essentially, this device has the same specifications as its brother-device, the Galaxy S6, so performance wise you can’t go wrong with either. What distinguishes the S6 Edge from its counterpart, of course, is the new Dual-Edge design, which has such features as a Night Clock, Edge Lighting (for special contacts when they call) and the People’s Edge, which keeps your top 5 contacts readily available (like speed dial) on the edge-screen. Also, when compared to the new IPhone 6s, the Galaxy S6/S6 Edge, for example, boasts of 3GB of RAM to Apple’s 1GB RAM, the front cam contains a 5MP lens and 16 in the rear, which double the camera specs of the new IPhone; and the display, Edge features 3.6M pixels to Apple’s 1M pixel display. So if we are talking hardware to performance ratio, the Galaxy S6 Edge has a major advantage over Apple’s latest flagship. In comparison with its counterpart, the Galaxy S6, the Edge wins in a beauty contest and is deadlocked for specs and performance. This phone is blazing fast and ultra-slim and is highly recommended.",Johannes Platonicus,Samsung_S6,1086

Samsung really did a good job this time around (as I am curently writing this from the phone) the only negative I have is the battery life, it's not to great but even then the fast charging makes up for it. As soon as I got this phone (3 days after it came out) I knew I needed a case and screen protected since both the front and the back are glass. There is no down side to this phone and if there is the then positives greatly outweigh the negatives this phone deserves the price tag.

Hell I've even used the Galaxy Mega 5.8 and 6.3 variants for a fair amount of time. I've never been a huge fan of the TouchWiz UI, but with Samsung using an in house processor to power this phone, the TouchWiz UI actually flies with the least amount of lag ever in its history.

I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. Samsung Galaxy S6 tries to be a revolutionary, but it is evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. So do check local specs. I played around with both S6 and S6 Edge for few days and my opinions are based on this. There are tons of reviews going into lot of details, so I am focused on few other aspects like what’s out there and how to compare specs. First Big Changes: No microSD or removable battery. I know many of you loyal Samsung fans says BUMMER! I was a die hard fan of Samsung till S4, then I went to LG G2/G3. I think this is the best bet for S6 to pull it off after a dismal year for Samsung last year. I was very curious to try out S6 and HTC One M9 as they are most talked about now. Many manufacturers are going away from microSD card slots and this is absolutely a must and is a key differentiator from iPhone. I am really sad Samsung decided to drop microSD card slot as well as no removable battery. Why?! Screen is a beauty on S6 – Just Gorgeous. Just go to a retail store and feel it! The Edge feature is still gimmicky. Unlike Note Edge, this has both sides so less dorky but still I am not sold yet. Unless you have loads of money, I will shy away from it for one more year and get it next year when they polish it up. It is certainly fancy and nice to show off, but I would rather buy an Android wear watch like Motorola 360 or Samsung Gear or LG R series. I like Motorola 360 but waiting for version 2 to appear. I like Round watches. IF YOU HAVE LAST YEAR model of any phone, PLEASE DON’T upgrade. Phones are becoming so standard and power packed it makes no sense to upgrade and waste money every year. I buy and sell so many phones as it is like a hobby for me, but I stick to one phone as primary for couple of years now. My main requirements are a 128 GB microSD, good screen, battery life and performance. I am trying hard to see if I can live without one. S6 and S6 Edge comes in a 128 GB variant and I will wait for prices to stabilize on this model. In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size, weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don’t advertise or mention SAR prominently. phone parameters: {size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR rating} Samsung Galaxy S6: 5.65 x 2.78 x 0.27 in, 138 gm, 1440 x 2560 pixels, 5.1 in, 577 ppi, 3 GB RAM, NO MICROSD SLOT (bummer), Internal Storage upto 128 GB, Exynos 7420 Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2.1 GHz Cortex-A57, Gorilla Glass 4, 16 MP/5MP camera, SAR 1.15 W/kg (head), 1.16 W/kg (body) NANO SIM Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge: Slightly lower dimensions, 0.01 in thicker, 6 gm less weight, Same resolution, Curved Screen, HTC One M9: 5.69 x 2.74 x 0.38 in, 157 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 3 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 20.7 MP (rear), 4 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 810, Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2 GHz Cortex-A57 Samsung Galaxy S5: 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 in, 145 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.1 in, 432 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, MSM8974-AC Processor: Quad core, 2500 MHz, Krait 400, 0.63 W/kg (head), 0.82 W/kg (body) HTC One M8: 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 in, 160 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 4 MP (rear), 5 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, Quad core, 2300 MHz, Krait 400, 0.94 W/kg (head), 0.83 W/kg (body) LG G3: 5.76 x 2.94 x 0.35 in, 149 gm, 2560 x 1440 pixels, 5.5 in, 538 pp",rpv,Samsung_S6,1095

I have to keep it on power saving mode just to make it through the day , even though it charges quickly - I'd prefer a longer lasting battery or at the very least the ability to change out the battery. Also, there are not a lot of options for really protective cases, the first time I dropped mine- the screen is cracked and is going to cost at least $200 to replace.",Kayleen W.,Samsung_S6,1096

This phone is Awesome in every aspect. Metal and Gorilla glass ( Samsung snagged Apple iPhone designer if you didn't know that & there 6 months ahead of Apple in technology) This phone is Solid! The learning curve was simple , just played around for a few hrs. The options, customizing you can do is unbelievable. The wireless charger is Fantastic (even with a case on phone). **The phone does seem to loose charge quick due to the bright screen and processor. (3 GB of Ram as opposed to Apples 1) Using a Battery save mode is a must, Battery is my one complaint with phone so far. The speed, ease of use which was a concern shouldn't even be a thought, I thought my iPhone was fast & flawless on Verizon, this thing loads in seconds! The Edge screen is a nice perk though right now it isn't up to its capabilities, there should be an update in near future where it does more. Camera is crystal clear, motion stabilizer works unbelievable...I must admit, I was real worried about move going from Apple to Samsung, but Samsung got it all right with this Edge. For what it's worth, I don't like change, but reading & research this was something I chanced on & it was the clear right change for me. For all you Apple people sick of buying iPhones just to have another , better one come out 5-6 months later, jump over to Galaxy, I know most people are afraid of change, but this phone will Not let you down. Awesome Phone all around! UPDATE: 4-21-15...Battery is HORRIBLE on this phone! Lost a star for it...This phone looses 20% of charge (100-80) sitting in cradle, with nothing running & screen off. Brought phone to Verizon and was told this has been a complaint? They literally watched battery drop in the 40 minutes I was there while they looked through settings. 100% -87%! This phone is beautiful, but how in the Hell can they plan to compete with a crap battery life! Great Phone, Poor battery life/performance. Anyone else having issues? Would love to know?? Samsung did an update/patch and battery still weak. Called Samsung and they taught me how to reboot Android system and walked me through a possible fix.

Read plenty of online reviews about the Edge before preordering it, most mentioned the ""gimmick"" that is the curved screen because of lack of functionality. To my mind this is a little like saying flat panel computer monitors were a gimmick because they did everything a CRT did -- they showed the picture, after all, they were just skinnier. ""All show, folks, nothing here to see, move along..."" Not so much. Now, what is a gimmick is the software that has been developed in order fend off complaints that the curved screen's real-estate isn't used efficiently. Edge contacts? Not all that essential or useful. Edge notifications? Same deal. What is really impressive is the effect the curved screen has on my viewing experience. One reviewer on another site wrote ""...gives the disturbing impression that the screen is falling away from me."" I balked at this because my experience is precisely the opposite, specifically that the screen is rising up to me. I hesitate to call it a 3D experience because that cheapens a true 3D display through something like MagicLeap, but it truly gives the impression that the screen has depth...because, well, it does. This is particularly noticed when using ""carousels"" to swipe through items on mobile websites & apps, e.g. Netflix. The items roll up one side of the screen then off the other to produce a more immersive experience. Same can be said about scrolling on Web pages while in landscape mode. Another cool/useful effect is when watching videos the ""edge"" is blacked out preventing distortion of the image but also provides a little extra screen space for widescreen movies. Also when swiping down to check notifications/battery life the notification & progress bar make use of the edge; in effect using less screen space & obscuring less of the video. The QHD display is also excellent with no pixellation visible under a hand lens. Enough about the screen. Processor & RAM make Android 5.0 run like a dream. I owned an S5 before picking up this gem & seriously regretted updating to Lollipop because the S5 just didn't handle it well -- abominable battery life, laaaaag, & it required multiple restarts through the day. None of these problems are evident on the S6. Battery life is good, but not excellent. Can stream videos for about six hours before it needs to be charged & survives a typical day with intermittent usage for ten to twelve hours. The real improvement here is the inclusion of wireless charging. I decided to forego the add-on backplate/battery for the S5 so I picked up a few wireless charging options this go around & I'm thrilled with the functionality. I have one in my car, on the end table, the bedside table & my desk. The convenience of being able to just drop/dock-&-go cannot be overstated & as a result my battery is seldom below 70%. The only improvement I can imagine is if they could figure out how to make my body a wireless charger. TouchWiz is a bit of a let-down, but not significantly so. It is stripped down so I'm not completely inundated with an UI that had the feeling of being added to with each iteration to ""improve"" it, as if adding every spice in the cupboard makes for a better soup. The app drawer is my biggest irritation because it is entirely inconvenient. Newly installed apps are added to the end of the list but apps can be sorted into alphabetical order by touching the A-Z at the top of the list. Now why is this irritating? First, it needs to be done each time you install an app. Second, while you can customize the app list to include your most frequently accessed apps on the first page so you don't have an entire screen dedicated to app icons that should properly be housed in the app drawer, the customization process is poorly designed, unintuitive & languid in end-user implementation. Third, after spending a great deal of time customizing the first page of the app drawer the next time you want to sort your apps alphabetically you lose all of your customization.

3 of 5 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 10, 2015","The choice to go with Glass and Aluminum makes this phone's appearance and quality appear to be much better than previous models. The button layout is still the same as older Galaxy models but the button presses now have a reassuring click. The frame is still similar to the other styles as it remains curved. The back gorilla glass is not removable and no longer allows for additional storage or easy battery replacements. The camera sticks out quiet a bit and creates a noticeable bulge on the back of the phone. The glass crystal that should protect the camera is not as strong as the sapphire module found on the iPhone line. The S6 is so lightweight and has a slight slippery feel to it. These are some of my first impressions, but I will break it down more in the rest of the review. Display: The 5.1 inch display is a good size for those who don't want a huge phone, but want a nice size screen. It's a quad-HD 2560X1440 resolution which works out to be 577 pixels per square inch. It has a wonderful display with deep blacks and highly vivid colors. You can always change the saturation to tune the color to your preference. It's incredible to watch with it's 2K resolution. The game play on this is awesome as the screen comes to life. It's bright enough to view in outside sunlight, although you get some glare on the screen. The screen is very sensitive to touch, but that's not always a bad thing. Hardware: The processor Exynos 7420 2.1ghz of performance with 3gb ram minimizes lag with lighting fast reactions from one task to the next. Mali graphics processor really enhances game play. The S6 is missing any expansion slots for external micro sd cards. The base storage for this phone is 32gb, with 64gb and 128gb available as a separate model. It's not upgradeable and you've got to decide what storage needs you have before purchase. It does have the best speakers Samsung has ever put out in the past. They are bottom facing speakers and don't give you as much sound as a rear or forward facing speaker would, but it does have a clear loud sound. The S6 has a much better heart rate monitor than other galaxy's, because of the placement of it. The finger print sensor is now a press type not a swipe type. It works much better than previous models. You can wake the phone while pressing and it unlocks the phone quickly when done as one motion. Battery: The battery is smaller than before at 2600mAh. It should be good for all day for most users. However some users may find it needing to be charged during the day. The s6 does support wireless charging. You can set power saving modes at different battery levels to help you get all day on a single charge. Power saving mode will reduce screen brightness, limit CPU performance, reduced frame rate, turn off touch key light, disable vibration and reduce time before the time is turned off after notifications. I really wish they would have improved the battery and given it a bigger battery capacity. This is potentially the biggest disappointment with the phone for me as I am a heavy user. Camera: The 16 megapixel camera on the back is an improvement as well as the 5 megapixel front facing camera. The camera has a Pro mode which adds extra features and effects. The ability to adjust the focus of a shot is great, you can even change it after the fact. It has good low light photo taking ability with both cameras. Video is available is slow mode as well as 4K, but you cannot benefit from HDR as you would in 1080p. HDR auto appears to be to light when you view your photographs. It does create stunning photos in regular lighting conditions. It features motion tracking and auto focus and keeps the image steady with out tapping the screen to refocus. This is the best camera on a Samsung model to date. Software: Touch wiz works flawlessly and the OS seems smooth thanks to the new hardware. Wiz no longer has those annoying sounds, just simple clicks. The setting screen is now decluttered and simpler to use. The lollipo",Justin D Blackburn,Samsung_S6,1102

1 of 2 people found the following review helpful,3,,"on July 15, 2015","I have the gold platinum 64 GB version. Aesthetically, this is a great looking phone, and it has a premium build. The best looking phone currently, better looking than any iPhone. The screen quality is also phenomenal. The edge functionality is somewhat overrated, but I loves the look of the edge. However, I absolutely hate the software. This is my first Samsung Galaxy phone, and supposedly, the S6 has a less obtrusive touchwhiz software compared to older galaxy phones. I'm coming from various Nexus phones, so I used to the vanilla-ness and snappiness of the Nexus phones. I now understand the touchwhiz hate. This biggest problem with the touchwhiz on S6 edge is lag. The lag is absolutely excruciating, and the initial lag on the lock screen is so awful. I have issues putting in the 4 pins to unlock this phone because the lag is so bad. After the phone unlocks, it takes awhile for the phone to get going. Occasionally, if you open an app to quickly after unlocking the phone, there could be a 30 second freeze. If you have music going while unlocking the phone, lag can potentially go on for eternity. Once the phone is up and running, it does run smooth. It's been 3 months, and I think the lag has somewhat gotten worse (not sure if this was due to the latest touchwhiz lollipop update). As for the Samsung apps themselves, my thoughts are 'meh'. I don't hate them, but I disabled what I could. I sort of like the S health which counts my steps. As for the battery, it's about average. The Nexus phones were about average for battery also, so no real change for me. I do think the S6 edge is slightly worse, but I think lots of the battery issues are due to TouchWhiz. Even with non-use, I can feel the phone getting hot in my pocket, and I'm sure the Samsung apps are just going crazy in the background. I don't take lots of pictures with my phone, but the camera is top notch. Maybe I would love this phone more, if I took more picture. Cyanogenmod folks have yet to crack this phone because of the proprietary chip exynos. If I can get another OS on this phone, such as vanilla android or cyanogenmod, I would do it in a heartbeat. Unless I can get acceptable OS on this phone, I'll likely go back to the Nexus (or Android Silver) when the next one is released this fall/winter. tl;dr Looks and the aesthetics: 5 stars, This phone is currently the best looking phone. Software: 1 star, I absolutely loathe TouchWhiz and the lag. Battery: 3 stars, The battery life is average Camera: 5 stars Overall: A little bit more than 3 stars.",BevoChan,Samsung_S6,1109

I have one in my car, on the end table, the bedside table & my desk. The convenience of being able to just drop/dock-&-go cannot be overstated & as a result my battery is seldom below 70%. The only improvement I can imagine is if they could figure out how to make my body a wireless charger. TouchWiz is a bit of a let-down, but not significantly so. It is stripped down so I'm not completely inundated with an UI that had the feeling of being added to with each iteration to ""improve"" it, as if adding every spice in the cupboard makes for a better soup. The app drawer is my biggest irritation because it is entirely inconvenient. Newly installed apps are added to the end of the list but apps can be sorted into alphabetical order by touching the A-Z at the top of the list. Now why is this irritating? First, it needs to be done each time you install an app. Second, while you can customize the app list to include your most frequently accessed apps on the first page so you don't have an entire screen dedicated to app icons that should properly be housed in the app drawer, the customization process is poorly designed, unintuitive & languid in end-user implementation. Third, after spending a great deal of time customizing the first page of the app drawer the next time you want to sort your apps alphabetically you lose all of your customiza",Amazon Customer,Samsung_S6,1111

The button layout is still the same as older Galaxy models but the button presses now have a reassuring click. The frame is still similar to the other styles as it remains curved. The back gorilla glass is not removable and no longer allows for additional storage or easy battery replacements. The camera sticks out quiet a bit and creates a noticeable bulge on the back of the phone. The glass crystal that should protect the camera is not as strong as the sapphire module found on the iPhone line. The S6 is so lightweight and has a slight slippery feel to it. These are some of my first impressions, but I will break it down more in the rest of the review. Display: The 5.1 inch display is a good size for those who don't want a huge phone, but want a nice size screen. It's a quad-HD 2560X1440 resolution which works out to be 577 pixels per square inch. It has a wonderful display with deep blacks and highly vivid colors. You can always change the saturation to tune the color to your preference. It's incredible to watch with it's 2K resolution. The game play on this is awesome as the screen comes to life. It's bright enough to view in outside sunlight, although you get some glare on the screen. The screen is very sensitive to touch, but that's not always a bad thing. Hardware: The processor Exynos 7420 2.1ghz of performance with 3gb ram minimizes lag with lighting fast reactions from one task to the next. Mali graphics processor really enhances game play. The S6 is missing any expansion slots for external micro sd cards. The base storage for this phone is 32gb, with 64gb and 128gb available as a separate model. It's not upgradeable and you've got to decide what storage needs you have before purchase. It does have the best speakers Samsung has ever put out in the past. They are bottom facing speakers and don't give you as much sound as a rear or forward facing speaker would, but it does have a clear loud sound. The S6 has a much better heart rate monitor than other galaxy's, because of the placement of it. The finger print sensor is now a press type not a swipe type. It works much better than previous models. You can wake the phone while pressing and it unlocks the phone quickly when done as one motion. Battery: The battery is smaller than before at 2600mAh. It should be good for all day for most users. However some users may find it needing to be charged during the day. The s6 does support wireless charging. You can set power saving modes at different battery levels to help you get all day on a single charge. Power saving mode will reduce screen brightness, limit CPU performance, reduced frame rate, turn off touch key light, disable vibration and reduce time before the time is turned off after notifications. I really wish they would have improved the battery and given it a bigger battery capacity. This is potentially the biggest disappointment with the phone for me as I am a heavy user. Camera: The 16 megapixel camera on the back is an improvement as well as the 5 megapixel front facing camera. The camera has a Pro mode which adds extra features and effects. The ability to adjust the focus of a shot is great, you can even change it after the fact. It has good low light photo taking ability with both cameras. Video is available is slow mode as well as 4K, but you cannot benefit from HDR as you would in 1080p. HDR auto appears to be to light when you view your photographs. It does create stunning photos in regular lighting conditions. It features motion tracking and auto focus and keeps the image steady with out tapping the screen to refocus. This is the best camera on a Samsung model to date. Software: Touch wiz works flawlessly and the OS seems smooth thanks to the new hardware. Wiz no longer has those annoying sounds, just simple clicks. The setting screen is now decluttered and simpler to use. The lollipo",Justin D Blackburn,Samsung_S6,1112

1 of 2 people found the following review helpful,3,,"on May 20, 2015","I am only commenting on one aspect of the phone - one handed operation. Outside of this I think this phone is great and recommend the other reviews for more information. I purchased this phone because it is small yet has a large screen. Nature didn't leave me with much extra room in my pockets, so this seemed to be the perfect large screen phone for me. I also chose the S6 Edge because it is narrow enough that I can reach every keyboard letter with the thumb of one hand while keeping my other hand free. However, when I reach for keys at the edge (the letter p for example), the base of my thumb touches the edge of the touchscreen, resulting in accidental key presses. This is profoundly annoying and prevents effective one handed operation. I think Samsung should be able to address this issue in software and hope they do. If they just added an option to disable touch sensitivity for one of the edges, that would go a long way. In the mean time I'm using a keyboard option that shifts all the keys to one side so I can avoid the reaching behavior that triggers the accidental screen presses, but they still happen occasionally.",The Dread Pirate Roberts,Samsung_S6,1119

I have a Samsung blu-ray player and it’s a very good blu-ray player. I have a Samsung Tablet and it is a great tablet. What the heck does this have to do with a Galaxy S6 Smart Phone review? Please keep reading I promise you won’t be sorry. First of all I just wanted to show that I am not a first time smart phone buyer nor first time galaxy buyer. As I said I had the S4 my wife’s S3 took a dump so I reluctantly gave her my S4 and bought an S6. I had the new S6 phone for almost a week. It has some great new features particularity the ability to keep the phone from locking when connected to anything in the exclusion list. Why is this important to me, it’s because I use my phone for work 99% - I work 100% remotely from home I am on it all day every day. Anyway, I quickly realized that most of the new features, why I liked this new phone, worked intermittently at best. I soon noticed I was dropping almost every call I made, the phone just seemed to be cursed. So, I took it back to where I bought it and they gave me a new one thinking I just got a bad phone. I was very skeptical and thought it was the new designed phone, crappy design and even worse mother boards. That Samsung had laid an egg with this new phone. Well, I was right!!!! This second phone acted and did the same thing. The battery lasts for like 30 minutes (being facetious) not too far off! The new features continued to act the same way, worked intermittently at best and the phone just seemed to be cursed. So, I called Samsung and this is where things get interesting. I worked with tech support and they couldn’t fix it they said send it in so we can fix it. I sent it in and within a week I had the phone back but I quickly noticed it was not zeroed out to factory settings as they said it would be. And there was no follow up call or e-mail or anything in the ticket online to say what they found. So, I called them and they told me “it has water damage” we can’t fix it!?!?!?!?!?! WTF!?!?!?!? Guys I’m telling you, I have used two of the phones now both brand new out of the box and they quite simply in short SUCK! I will now come across as a disgruntled customer spewing silly rhetoric but I don’t care. What I am saying is all true and if my phone really had water damage then the serial number sticker I specifically left stuck to the back of the phone would surely have water damage, it does not. I DID NOT CAUSE WATER DAMAGE TO MY PHONE. I pleaded with Samsung to replace my phone and they said they would talk to their supervisor and call me back. Well, you guessed it no call back after a week so far. I was involved with the first Pentium PC processors when they first came out, the company I worked for got a bad first batch and the big blue company that made them and installed them had to replace about 150 mother boards from that first batch. IT does happen. DO NOT BUY THE S6, you will be sorry, especially if you use the phone for anything other than calls, texting or taking pictures.

REALLY pretty! However, it is VERY slippery in the hand. I was so nervous I'd drop it in the 24 hours before my case arrived (Galaxy S6 Edge case, E LV Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge (SHOCK PROOF DEFENDER) Slim Case Cover - Impact Protection **NEW**[Black] Ultimate protection from drops and impacts for Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge [BLACK / BLACK])! I've had the phone for 2 weeks now and all of the functions it advertises work. I'm still figuring some of them out and had the price not been so good on Amazon, I wouldn't have sprung for the edge. The notifications and people functions are cool, but totally unnecessary. The fingerprint scanner was easy to set up to work with multiple fingers (up to 4) and works very well. The backup password is more secure than a typical 4 digit code (had to be at least 8(?) characters),though I haven't had any problems opening the phone with my fingerprint. The heart rate monitor is really cool. I've been checking it at various times of the day and it's cool to see how low (or high!) your heart rate is. Overall, the response to using apps and web pages is fast. It loads webpages really quickly, email was easy to set up and my gmail and hotmail accounts are easy to access from the same icon and I can switch between them with a simple swipe. My work email loads quickly and works as expected as well. The way the email system is set up, it allows you to swipe right or left to get to the next or previous message which I've found rather convenient. So far, the battery is great! I've been warned against ""over charging"" so I never leave it charging overnight, as I did my previous phone. The fast charging is really super-fast. I'd say it gets a full charge in less than 2 hours. I've charged in the evening prior to going to bed, stopped it at 95% and it was still around 20% the following night with moderate to heavy use (no gaming/video streaming, just talk, text, email, web-surfing). The camera does take very clear shots of stable scenes. Haven't played with the settings or different modes at all yet. Straight auto shooting of moving kids haven't always been clear, but that's more likely due to user error than the fault of the camera. Unless this is also user-error (I haven't looked into it yet) I cannot seem to take a picture directly from a text message. With my old phone I could go into a group message, take a picture and have it automatically attach to the message. If this phone allows that, it isn't an obvious feature. Ditto for simply attaching an existing picture to a message. I have to go into the gallery, pick the picture, add the recipients, and then write a message to send it. Again, this might be a function I haven't figured out yet, but it shouldn't be rocket science to do this. There's usually a little paper clip somewhere in the messaging app that allows attachments. Not so on this phone. I bought a tempered glass protector, but it made it very difficult for the phone to recognize my touch. I ended up removing it as I was too frustrated by it. That may a problem of the protector I chose (S6 Edge Screen Protector, AOKDO [Full Screen Coverage] Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector Film for Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge (clear)) rather than the phone, but my screen is currently naked and I am worried about it breaking as it seems pretty fragile. I will say it is a bit glitchy at times even without the screen protector. I have had issues with it not responding to my touch when I try to scroll up/down or open an application. Not often enough to make me want to return it, but annoying none the less (especially since I chose this phone over another due to the frequency of complaints on reviews of the other phone for this exact issue). I'm hoping it doesn't get worse over time. There is a system update pending, but I haven't allowed it without doing a little research. Maybe that will fix the issue.

0 of 1 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on May 17, 2015","When buying this phone as an early adopter, there are a few things to keep in mind. 1. Quick charging can cause screen rotation to be permanently locked in a single direction. The current work around is to use your old android charger or to use the Qi pad type chargers. For this reason, I put a sticky note on the charger that came with my phone and stuck it in a drawer. 2. WiFi can have issues. My workaround ended up being to disable MAC address filtering on my router. This isn't my preference, but I'll have to check my router for intruders more often. The screen resolution blows my previous phone (Motorola Droid RAZR HD) out of the water. The speed of the phone (8 cores vs 2 cores) also makes me feel like I'm on my wife's solid state Lenovo Yoga. When browsing using Chrome, it really does feel like you have a laptop in the palm of your hand. The only time I noticed the phone heating up is when downloading and installing many new apps one right after the other (either on 4G Verizon or CenturyLink 20MBps DSL). In normal use when the screen isn't so active, the phone runs at normal temperatures. These days with many apps storing your data in the cloud it was super easy to get all of my data/apps back on this phone. The camera is also pretty decent in low light situations as compared to my previous phone. It won't replace my Nikon DSLR, but it gets the job done in a pinch. When using the camera, the screen resolution is so high that you almost feel like the outer edges of your phone contain a hole in the middle filled with air. This is the first phone I've felt this sensation when taking photos in natural light. My wife who normally doesn't notice screen resolution at all commented that the display was excellent. I've ordered a charging Qi pad from Amazon and I anticipate it will let me charge cable free just fine once it arrives. From all the android phones we've had over the years, there are chargers all over the house which will supplement the Qi pad. With active use on a Sunday, I got the phone down to 75% by noon so it will definitely get me through a normal weekend/work day. I do miss having a Micro SD slot and I do agree with others that Samsung should have kept a removable battery. In a sense, designing a phone in this way supports the general public switching to new smart phones every 2-3 years. Replaceable batteries could end up hurting the profits of Samsung and Apple in the long run. From a consumer point of view though, I am hopeful they can bring this feature back in the future considering that Google is pushing for less smart phone waste in the future with phones designed lego style. As this phone is larger than my previous phone, typing in portrait mode is a little more comfortable than landscape mode. Perhaps I'll feel differently once I've had the phone for a while. I never lock my phone so I don't have a use for the fingerprint function. It was nice being able to delete many of the default apps that come with my phone that I don't plan on using (bundled games, etc). I always thought it was stupid for a phone manufacturer to leave ""locked apps"" on a phone which themselves eventually become obsolete or useless due to the pace of technology. I haven't had this phone long enough to need a cache clear or anything like that, but hopefully the process is as simple as it was with my old RAZR. Finally, the curved screen is a nice design touch. I haven't used any features of the curved screen (flashing colors for certain callers, scrolling the time at night, etc) and I have got used to touching some menu elements on the curved screen. The menu elements took about a day to get used to touching slightly more the side of the phone than the top screen, but it's intuitive now and comfortable. The glass feeling of the phone feels extremely high quality.

0 of 1 people found the following review helpful,5,,"on April 13, 2015","X-posted. Read plenty of online reviews about the Edge before preordering it, most mentioned the ""gimmick"" that is the curved screen because of lack of functionality. To my mind this is a little like saying flat panel computer monitors were a gimmick because they did everything a CRT did -- they showed the picture, after all, they were just skinnier. ""All show, folks, nothing here to see, move along..."" Not so much. Now, what is a gimmick is the software that has been developed in order fend off complaints that the curved screen's real-estate isn't used efficiently. Edge contacts? Not all that essential or useful. Edge notifications? Same deal. What is really impressive is the effect the curved screen has on my viewing experience. One reviewer on another site wrote ""...gives the disturbing impression that the screen is falling away from me."" I balked at this because my experience is precisely the opposite, specifically that the screen is rising up to me. I hesitate to call it a 3D experience because that cheapens a true 3D display through something like MagicLeap, but it truly gives the impression that the screen has depth...because, well, it does. This is particularly noticed when using ""carousels"" to swipe through items on mobile websites & apps, e.g. Netflix. The items roll up one side of the screen then off the other to produce a more immersive experience. Same can be said about scrolling on Web pages while in landscape mode. Another cool/useful effect is when watching videos the ""edge"" is blacked out preventing distortion of the image but also provides a little extra screen space for widescreen movies. Also when swiping down to check notifications/battery life the notification & progress bar make use of the edge; in effect using less screen space & obscuring less of the video. The QHD display is also excellent with no pixellation visible under a hand lens. Enough about the screen. Processor & RAM make Android 5.0 run like a dream. I owned an S5 before picking up this gem & seriously regretted updating to Lollipop because the S5 just didn't handle it well -- abominable battery life, laaaaag, & it required multiple restarts through the day. None of these problems are evident on the S6. Battery life is good, but not excellent. Can stream videos for about six hours before it needs to be charged & survives a typical day with intermittent usage for ten to twelve hours. The real improvement here is the inclusion of wireless charging. I decided to forego the add-on backplate/battery for the S5 so I picked up a few wireless charging options this go around & I'm thrilled with the functionality. I have one in my car, on the end table, the bedside table & my desk. The convenience of being able to just drop/dock-&-go cannot be overstated & as a result my battery is seldom below 70%. The only improvement I can imagine is if they could figure out how to make my body a wireless charger. TouchWiz is a bit of a let-down, but not significantly so. It is stripped down so I'm not completely inundated with an UI that had the feeling of being added to with each iteration to ""improve"" it, as if adding every spice in the cupboard makes for a better soup. The app drawer is my biggest irritation because it is entirely inconvenient. Newly installed apps are added to the end of the list but apps can be sorted into alphabetical order by touching the A-Z at the top of the list. Now why is this irritating? First, it needs to be done each time you install an app. Second, while you can customize the app list to include your most frequently accessed apps on the first page so you don't have an entire screen dedicated to app icons that should properly be housed in the app drawer, the customization process is poorly designed, unintuitive & languid in end-user implementation.

While last year's S5 took many steps in the right direction(being somewhat waterproof with better material and craftsmanship), it still wasn't there to make it a mouth-watering phone yet, like what HTC did when they first introduced their One M7, or whenever Apple introduces a new iPhone size. This year, Samsung has finally learned from both of their competitors, and made a phone that has all the good qualities of both, plus some of their own. Finally, this is the Galaxy S that you've always wanted and been dreaming of. * LOOKS/FORM-FACTOR/MATERIALS: The very first thing you notice when you handle the phone, is its new design and form factor - finally Samsung has completed their transformation of getting rid of all that ugly plastic parts. Now it is just all glass and metal, and now it is truly beautiful. The metal fully wraps around the edges ofthe phone. The back is beautiful, the sides are beautiful - heck, even the buttons are beautiful. It feels great in the hand, and oozes style and sophistication. The S6 Edge is just so unique-looking - it is the most beautiful phone I've seen in a long time. And contrary to what people might say or what you might think, the two sloped edges are not awkward to handle, does not dig into your skin, and is not uncomfortable to grip. * SCREEN: The very next thing you notice, of course, is the screen. I am continually pleasantly surprised at the evolution of Samsung's AMOLED technology - it has now became the best screen in the industry, hands down. I used to defend the LCD technology of the HTC M7, and at that point it was in fact overall superior to the Samsung S4 because the AMOLED then had issues in the sun, and color reproduction(it was too saturated and not natural). But now, they have fixed those issues, and the S6's screen is just quite simply the best. If you don't believe it, just compare an LG/Samsung OLED TV to any LED TVs today. I still think 5.1 inches for a screen of a PHONE is still too big, but overall, for what smartphones represent nowadays, it is acceptable - we have conditioned ourselves to accept the bigger sizes of smartphones(I remember when I first held a 4.2"" smartphone when it first came out - the HTC HD2 - and thought, ""what the h3ll is this monstrosity??""). * It doesn't hurt that Samsung boosted up the resolution to 1440 x 2560 pixels, which is approximately 577 ppi in pixel density. Although this is quite overkill right now, it's always nice to have the latest and greatest technology - that's the reason why we buy these overpriced phones in the first place, isn't it? It is also very bright, and sunlit legibility is excellent. Color reproduction is quite accurate, and like the S5, you can choose different color modes to suit your liking. *BATTERY LIFE: An important aspect to discuss is the battery life, now more than ever because there is no removable back cover to make replacing the battery easily like before, not to mention there is no microSD slot for you to add memory space to your phone. Comparatively, the S6 Edge is supposed to last a little more than the S6 regular, which I've read is less than last year's S5. But I'm one of those who are always around a charger, and I always carry external battery packs in my backpack when I travel, so that's never a concern. Seriously, who even buys an extra battery anymore - which you can only use for a single specific phone model - when your external battery can charge ANY and ALL phones and tablets?? This scenario only makes sense if your work is so demanding that you don't have extra time to charge the phone, and need to swap batteries IMMEDIATELY. I don't think that scenario is realistic nowadays when external batteries are so small, light, and cheap. My S6 goes from 100% at 10 am to about 40% at 10 pm with moderate use - so no definitely no complaints there. I get home, plug it up, and there are no issues. In fact, with the same amount of usage, this phone outlasts my Note Edge,",Johnny Amazon®,Samsung_S6,1146

While last year's S5 took many steps in the right direction(being somewhat waterproof with better material and craftsmanship), it still wasn't there to make it a mouth-watering phone yet, like what HTC did when they first introduced their One M7, or whenever Apple introduces a new iPhone size. This year, Samsung has finally learned from both of their competitors, and made a phone that has all the good qualities of both, plus some of their own. Finally, this is the Galaxy S that you've always wanted and been dreaming of. * LOOKS/FORM-FACTOR/MATERIALS: The very first thing you notice when you handle the phone, is its new design and form factor - finally Samsung has completed their transformation of getting rid of all that ugly plastic parts. Now it is just all glass and metal, and now it is truly beautiful. The metal fully wraps around the edges ofthe phone. The back is beautiful, the sides are beautiful - heck, even the buttons are beautiful. It feels great in the hand, and oozes style and sophistication. The S6 Edge is just so unique-looking - it is the most beautiful phone I've seen in a long time. And contrary to what people might say or what you might think, the two sloped edges are not awkward to handle, does not dig into your skin, and is not uncomfortable to grip. * SCREEN: The very next thing you notice, of course, is the screen. I am continually pleasantly surprised at the evolution of Samsung's AMOLED technology - it has now became the best screen in the industry, hands down. I used to defend the LCD technology of the HTC M7, and at that point it was in fact overall superior to the Samsung S4 because the AMOLED then had issues in the sun, and color reproduction(it was too saturated and not natural). But now, they have fixed those issues, and the S6's screen is just quite simply the best. If you don't believe it, just compare an LG/Samsung OLED TV to any LED TVs today.

I cannot emphasize how unhappy I am with the S6 Edge. While sitting in a chair not even using the phone, it slipped out of my pocket and fell about a foot to the ground where it immediately cracked.

The only good thing about this model is the Camera and multiple frames it can take per second. Rest it is not worth 800 USD. I bought this just to have multiple apps running at the same time but have found that it really slows down moving from one app to another app making it slower and slower. 3 GB RAM was attractive part to me but it really is not helping in spite making sure that there is not much in RAM during any given time. So bottom line from my experience it really an't worth this price and there are many cheaper alternatives for much much better price.,Manpreet Goraya,Samsung_S6,1155

4 of 10 people found the following review helpful,1,,"on July 27, 2015","This phone has been nothing but a nightmare for me since day one. The navigation is appalling. Samsung bloats the device with too many apps and unnecessary navigation buttons. One would think that's a positive thing, but it just clutters the interface and does absolutely nothing to make your experience seamless. I didn't realize when I switched from the iPhone the creature comforts I would grow to miss. Like the ability to navigate to my voicemails easily. Samsung requires about five taps of the finger just to find your voicemail box. If you open up a page in the internet app, it will ask you every single time if you would like to open the page with the Internet app, Google Chome App, Yelp app or God knows what else. You can select ""No, Never,"" ""Yes, Always,"" or ""Just This Once,"" but it never saves that information, so it just defaults to asking you every single time you want to view a web page, which makes getting the information you want tedious and frustrating. There is also a blue touch nav button that stays pinned on the screen and is ALWAYS in the way, whether covering the clock, blocking your keyboard or hovering over a page you are trying to view. I've tried everything to get rid of it, but I've had to resort to simply moving it manually every time it's in the way. My text messages do not show up on my lock screen. Only the most random notifications, like that I had a meeting two days ago (which, by the way, it didn't notify me of when it was actually time for the meeting), that a random Facebook friend I have not talked to in years just added a photo or that an app I have never used just updated. Nothing whatsoever that I would find necessary, like, say, that I have a missed call. On multiple occasions, someone has called or texted and I have had absolutely zero notification And no, I have not been able to find any way to customize this in my settings. The sound quality on phone calls is horrible. Always a crackling noise. There is no button on the side of the phone to switch it to silent/vibrate. You have to unlock your screen, toggle over to a dashboard screen, scroll over to an audio button and press a couple times to silence. Not exactly user-friendly when someone is calling you during a meeting and you realize your sound is on. I also cannot view photos sent by email or PDFs on the web without having to download to a hidden folder buried in my phone and toggle over five different screens to access it. It does not allow me to upload downloaded videos to Instagram. I am required to film the video live on the app. And typing on the keyboard is not exactly pleasant for your thumbs, because the keyboard goes over the edges of the screen. The battery life sucks. I'm lucky if I can get a day's worth of juice out of it. The phone has actually become slower over time. There's about a three-second delay when pressing the home screen button. The one benefit is the excellent photo quality, but that's about it. And even that is frustrating, because photos are broken out into different folders based on apps you used. There is no master gallery and photos that are not taken with the phone get relegated to a separate download folder on the phone. In order to save it to my gallery, I have to take a screenshot. This phone is a gimmick. Not much thought went into the user experience. It was a desperate attempt to do what Apple has been dragging on: Dazzling us with a brand new, unexpected design. I do not recommend, especially if you're hesitant about switching from Apple to Samsung. The end of my two-year contract could not come soon enough.",Swanzy,Samsung_S6,1196

8 of 19 people found the following review helpful,1,,"on April 20, 2015","Just wanna share my rant on ""don't buy s6 edge"". There was a wifi problem with the device that I purchased on the release date. Would stay connected, but upstream / downstream freezes every 20~30 seconds. I tried on different network, security settings, and bandwidth, but problem persisted. Then sent it for service at Samsung repair center, and I was promised of expedited service. More than a week passed, still no news. I called the service center today, and found out that device is still sitting in the warehouse, waiting to be repaired. And here's why S6 is awful : 1. They have not fully tested S6 prior to its release. Lots of bugs (app crash / battery drain), which most of them are negligible, but ones like wifi problem, is critical. Good luck on picking the phone lottery. 2. Awful customer service. I had to call three times / chat twice, spending more than 4 hours to find out where my device is and whether it is being fixed or not. The service center promised for expedited service, as well as promised the date when I will get the device back, but only later found out those words were nothing but empty promise to dupe customers. Also, as I escalated my call to higher level agent (or manager), they were keep blaming on me and making falsified statements that I never received an expedited service - whereas, online repair tracker clearly indicates the device was sent in for an expedited service. Classic blame-game from incompetent / unwilling call agents. Prepare to be frustrated when you have issues with the phone. Expect more than an hour for a call. BOTTOM LINE : Do not buy the device. Don't be fooled by the looks. Service is awful at most. Go ahead and buy iPhone or Moto X. They do not screw customer like Samsung, and they take responsibilities for faulty devices. People at Samsung do not respect your time, and would not acknowledge their fault in poor manufacturing. For this price tag, you all deserve better.",Won Suh,Samsung_S6,1203
